				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2> Galaxcity Is Galaxy Full of Fun For Kids Day Out In Tokyo</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Touch wood Tokyo weather is generally pleasant. But there are days when it&#8217;s cold and rainy. Now what do you do if it&#8217;s cold and rainy, and you have kids who so looked forward to a days outing on weekend. It&#8217;s tough. </span>For such hard times GalaxCity comes to your rescue. It&#8217;s indoor but Indoor does not mean video games. No, nope. It&#8217;s full of activities, like scaling up a rock climbing wall, learning about planets and space, making creative use of paper and stuff. in short, as the name says, its a galaxy of fun for kids day out in Tokyo. And it&#8217;s all provided courtesy city municipality. Read on if you are interested.</p>
<div id="attachment_1287" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1287" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-300x300.jpg" alt="Learning about space and asteroids" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Learning about space and asteroids</p></div>
<h3>The Planetarium</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rin and Paku, the two kids separated from their family. They were born in tough times. Like just when young Rin flopped out of her egg shell, she was attacked by a hungry Tyrannosaur! Thankfully mom reached just in time!. But mommy had to mind a cackle of kids. So Rin soon again found herself lost. winter setting in there was little that Rin could do. After all the place was Alaska, known to have particularly severe winter. Luckily she found Paku, a member from her brood. Together they braved some really tough winter. And a deadly encounter with another monstrous Tyrannosaur. Rin was picked up hanging by the jaws. Just in time Paku the braveheart came running and lunged at the tyrant. The blow threw the mean beast into cold icy water. Then spring came. Good times followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the story projected on a huge planetarium wall. Mixed with oodles of knowledge bits on evolution of earth and the solar system, how seasons change with earth&#8217;s orbit, and about evolution of life. Which kid do you think would not love it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the kids parents, the low low prices were an added surprise. A full planetarium in the middle of the busy Adachi city. screening various shows on space, rockets, animals, adventure etc etc. for a coin! Yeah one felt Happy to have paid taxes, for once.</span><br />

<h3>Net Athletics Zone</h3>
<div id="attachment_1284" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1284 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002.jpg" alt="The Galaxcity Net Athletics Zone" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Galaxcity Net Athletics Zone &#8211; full of fun day for kids in Adachi Tokyo</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this planetarium was just an added bonus, Icing on the cake. If your kids love to play, jump, run, then you should first hit the central hall. It&#8217;s a three storied high world made of nets. Nets make the first floor, the second, the third. Connected through chutes, made of nets. Kids can jump a la trampoline style. Go up an incline and slide down. Or simply lie down like on a hammock and enjoy the vibrations courtesy others.</span></p>
<h3>The Climbing Wall</h3>
<div id="attachment_1289" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1289" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007.jpg" alt="The Climbing Wall" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Climbing Wall</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is not enough, then go for the climbing wall. Three story high, with safety harness, helmets, belaying cable. instructors using laser pointers to guide the young mountaineers to the next best hold.</span></p>
<h3>Digital Play</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, if your kid is still too young for climbing, how about some learning through digital play? There&#8217;s a room with two screens for engaging the younger ones. On the first, letters fall from a tree, like leaves in fall. The kids have to catch the letters that make up particular word. The word is shown in the beginning. Hang on, it&#8217;s not just that. The word is not written as it is but a picture is shown. The kid has to get the word and then catch the falling letters in sequence. As is expected the letters fall all over the place, just like fall leaves on a breezy day. So kids need to move/jump/run a bit to catch.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1286" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1286 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004.jpg" alt="Digital Play" width="741" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Digital Play</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next screen projects a collection of colored shapes. The more active the kid standing in front, the more colors come up. </span></p>
<h3>For The Creative Ones</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next out there, there are a couple of painting and craft making rooms. The creative ones will love the bright spacious rooms, with several tables in each. Parents and children are free to pick up the art objects or craft items. Instructors are there, too.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1285" style="width: 164px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1285 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-154x300.jpg" alt="Art and Craft classes" width="154" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-300x583.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003.jpg 381w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Art and Craft classes</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is still one more &#8211; a baby&#8217;s play pen. Secure, colorful, soft matted, with plenty of space to crawl about.</span></p>
<h3>Essential Bits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Do you agree all the above makes for a cool day out? If still wondering about stuff such as food, then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">worry not, that also is taken care of nicely. An attached restaurant right outside serves yummy dishes like curry rice, chicken rice, pasta, sandwiches in a well lit colorful setting. Of course vending machines are there at every floor, as you would surely expected.</span></p>
<p>One caveat &#8211; you need to reach early and buy tickets early otherwise space fills up soon. Secondly, socks is a must everywhere. And thirdly no skirts/frocks only trousers. Oh yes its not so touristy so Nihongo dake de onegai shimas (guides speak only Japanese) &#8230;</p>
<p>For booking and latest shows refer to the website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.galaxcity.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.galaxcity.jp/</a></p>
<h3>More Choices</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one thing about this Galaxcity is that it&#8217;s slightly off the main Tokyo city amusement / shopping areas. If you wanted to combine shopping then check <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/kids-day-out-in-tokyo-science-playareum/" target="_blank">Sony ExploraScience</a> or <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/panasonic-risupia-science-for-kids/" target="_blank">Panasonic Risupia</a> in Odaiba. Or full play and only play, then head to Children&#8217;s world in Shibuya. On the other hand if a day full of learning is the demand, then check out <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/science-museum-tokyo-dayout-for-kids/" target="_blank">Science Museum</a>. Did somebody just say what to do it&#8217;s raining on a weekend …?</span></p>

<div id="attachment_1220" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1220" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TREECLIMB00001-203x300.jpg" alt="Tree climbing as a sports in Tokyo" width="203" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TREECLIMB00001-203x300.jpg 203w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TREECLIMB00001-300x444.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TREECLIMB00001.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tree climbing as a sport arrives in Tokyo</p></div>
<h3>Tree Climbing as a sport arrives in Tokyo</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are everywhere &#8211; clambering up, swaying from a branch, or just hanging. Waving at the viewers below. Boys and girls, young or err no so young. Everybody trying their hands, and legs, at tree climbing as this latest craze hits Tokyo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days when one would scan  the neighborhood trees for ripe fruits on the way to school. And launch assault on the way back. Cuts and bruises were part of the game. The odd broken limb was when things didn&#8217;t work to plan. That was it, simple pleasures of simple times.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But times changed. Sophistication has changed the approach if not the urge.  Apparently tree climbing  is still fun. Lots of fun. Provided you are part of a registered organization with necessary safety gear and licenses to operate. It&#8217;s a recognized sport. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1217"></span></p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Tree climbing as a sport evolved first in the Wild West. There is a Wikipedia  entry as well. It kinda says tree climbing evolved even before there was internet! Back in the nineteen hundred and eighties! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has gained popularity recently. Now there is an international governing body &#8211; Tree Climbers Internal Inc. (TCI) With branches in USA Canada UK Australia Malaysia China Japan Indonesia etc. Global Organization of Tree Climbers (GOTC) is mandated with the task of framing standards and certifying local bodies. After all it involves all the nitty gritties of mountain climbing, with climbing-harnesses, carabiners, and an assorted bunch of ropes being tools of the trade. One needs to learn various knots frequently used is mountaineering such as Munter Hitch, Prussic Knots and others such. Helmet, gloves and eye protection glasses are also needed, in case you wondered. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is it really like</strong><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s really not that difficult after all. At least that is what one felt having attended one such climbing session recently held in Tokyo. Kids lined up grouped into batches for a two hour session each. In this session they were introduced to the techniques of how to climb up, and belay down, with the assortment of ropes and knots already set up for them by the organizers Tree Climbing Japan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK let&#8217;s take a close look. The rule book  requires one to first find a tree with sturdy branches. Then Get under one branch  that does not have leaves obstructing the way up. Aim high and fling a rope long enough to coil around the branch and come hanging down. Pull it tight. Fix one end of the rope with a weight. And  attach a carabiner at the other end. Take a smaller rope, fix one end to the same carabiner and another end to the longer rope knotted in such a way that it can move up or down. This is the cord that will help you get up or down. Move the knot up, it pulls you up. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Knots and hitches</strong><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here the trick is in how you tie this knot. It&#8217;s called a Prusic knot. When slack it can be moved up or down sliding on the main rope. But if there&#8217;s a pull then it tightly clutches the rope. When you fix the carabiner to your harness, and push the Prusic knot up, you are basically hanging down from this knot. If this were not gripping the main rope tightly enough you would slide down. So the better is the knot, the safer you are. To be extra safe climbers tie additional knots on the main rope that can work as a break  in case somehow the Prusic knot fails to hold. These breaks are tied at intervals as the climber goes up. And untied with a pull on the way back down. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Pushing up </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To push up you use a cord as foot board. It one smaller cord that is tied a little below the Prusic knot. This also is a Prusic knot, a smaller one  that can slide up or down the main rope. It is tied together at the two ends so that it forms a loop. This is the foot rest. Climber pushes on the foot rest to go up. Then loosens the main knot and pushes that up. It is the next stop where the climbers weight will hold it tight. Next the climber pulls the foot rest up, pushes it down with his foot. This rope works as a ladder for him. He steps on it to lift himself up. Then again he moves the main knot once more upwards. And follows this motion to climb up all the way to the branch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kyosumi Garden One Traditional Japanese Garden In Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best traditional Japanese styles garden in Tokyo is in this sleepy east part of Tokyo, Kyosumi Garden. Once it was a private garden, belonging to Mitsubishi group. In the Meiji era this was the property of Mitsubishi patriarch Kinokuniya San. From then till now &#8211; over last close to hundred and fifty years this area of Tokyo has undergone a sea change. But this one garden has been well preserved under care of Mitsubishi group. Being accessible only to company high ranking officials and their guests this garden maintained its originality, oblivious of all the rapid changes happening around.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3240.8507755459514!2d139.79561561491894!3d35.680676180194375!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6018893e17559757%3A0xf238b51ea3c37819!2sKiyosumi+Garden!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1475903959614" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was built around a central pond, with wooden bridges, tea house, undulating small hills and valleys, forests full of Japanese pines, maples,  junipers, and bamboo groves. Stone steps led to the bridge below an artificial waterfall. Water worn old stones having specific religious bearings were shipped in from distant places around Japan and positioned carefully in the landscape. The ambiance is still there.</p>
<div id="attachment_1098" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1098" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg" alt="One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it&#8217;s maintained by local government. For a minimal entry fee charged. It&#8217;s a few minutes walk from Toei Oedo line or Hanzomon line Kyosumi Shirakawa station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being somewhat away from the city center and key tourist attractions, the surroundings still bear the distant old Japan look. No Mc burgers, save for Denny&#8217;s if you plan for a lunch nearby. Neither too many Izakayas &#8211; the Japanese restaurants.. Traditional residential area. Shops still actually sell fresh veg produce in wooden baskets!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The walking route</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once inside you might like to follow the Arrow pointing towards the walking route. If you don&#8217;t though, you won&#8217;t be lost since there&#8217;s not many paths to choose from anyway. Walk towards the central pond, keep walking around anti clockwise. Go Past the walkway made of stone slabs. Step Across the bridge. Make your way over the stones underneath which the goldfish and the turtles laze around. Take the walk up the small tree-covered slope. Take your time. The view from here encompasses the entire water body surrounded by the green hills with a central tea room. The entire panorama in one frame. There are benches for the ones wishing to take the view in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1096" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1096" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg" alt="Panoramic view point" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Panoramic view point</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path goes further ahead passing around the tea room. It&#8217;s restricted access no peeking around please. The walkway divides. An adjacent garden comes into view. There is a wooden pavilion, and several wooden barbecue style tables. Good for taking a bento break. This area is sometimes used by those modern yoga healing classes.</p>
<div id="attachment_1099" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1099" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg" alt="The creek of Pines" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The creek of Pines</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walk Back</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From here visitors head back to the walking course that snakes behind the tea room and heads towards a narrow creek. Gold Fishes crowd around the creek. A few weather worn stones, with Japanese maples cedars and ferns growing around them create an image of a land far off. Pristine. Where waterfalls glisten in the morning sunshine, gurgling down the quiet valley. Curiously a stork some day found its way here, and since called this place home.</p>
<div id="attachment_1100" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1100" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg" alt="Time for a break" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Time for a break</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pathway past this point again starts going up.  Turns left once the Stone lamp stand comes into view. A lane goes straight ahead, heading towards the lily beds. Another forks left towards a green island, past a small bridge.</p>
<div id="attachment_1103" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1103 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg" alt="The bridge towards the central island" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The bridge towards the central island</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1102" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1102" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg" alt="A hazy winter morning" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A hazy winter morning</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The walk ends at a traditional ryokan style hall, glass  covered, with extended wooden patio. The grass lawn and the pebbled walkways merge back where the arrow said Start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Autumn is said to be the best time to enjoy this park. It&#8217;s amongst one of the sites to enjoy Fall colors right in Tokyo. At other times also, it does not fail to impress. A break from the civilized world for a couple of hours. Priceless.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Water Sports Wind Surfing near Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I spent another summer lazing around, one realization struck me. That I am now in my forties. No longer awaiting the future. Reached it. Things would perhaps no longer take a surprise new direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grew up dreaming to be a famous sportsman. With the usual paraphernalia of jazzy cars and glammodelz obviously following in. Then came the Internet age. The gap between me and the millions was just a startup away!</p>
<div id="attachment_1111" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1111" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007.jpg" alt="Sunset at Shonan Beach" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset at Shonan Beach</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No more. No more competition. Phelps won a few more medals. Well .. So? Let him keep those, poor fellow. Mark Zuckerberg went ahead, packing his millions. Hmm that one also got away.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mark II</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Never mind. I made up my mind. Away from the daily drudgery of coding / bug fixing. I booked a day off for wind surfing! Yep. Would float on water. Fly on sail. Like a butterfly. Was already floating on cloud nine days before the D day. Critics / critiques called it midlife crisis. Huh!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being in Japan has this incredible advantage. You can go for mountain climbing, or go for ocean sports, all within an hours distance. My surf boarding destination was Kamakura. Yuigahama beach. An hours JR line travel from Shinjuku, then 2 stations on Denen Toshi line.</p>
<div id="attachment_1120" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1120" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg" alt="Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kamakura Shonan area, the beach side neighborhood, is a close cousin of Hawaii with surfing , water scootering and all such sports enthusiasts crowding the neon lit pubs or skating down the wide palm lined bouleavverds. Fresh sea food restaurants jostle for attention along with Pizzarias and Berger joints.</p>
<p>Yuigahama, Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture 248-0014<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Called up the surfing school the day before. Weather was expected to be fine. Procedure was simple. Pay Jpy 7560/-, tax inclusive. Change into wetsuit, follow the instructor to the beach across the road.</p>
<div id="attachment_1122" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1122" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006.jpg" alt="Fishing boats by the beach" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fishing boats by the beach</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far so good. Ocean waves were washing my feet. Wait, patience, I quietly admonished myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Problems started when it was time to rig the stuff. Base joint, sail up, boom, nose, fin &#8211; words were grazing past me as I kept trying to make sense of rest of the sound bites. Curse. My Japanese Business language proficiency was no good for marine sports.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Loop:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Class over we stepped into the water. The gentle touch of splashing waves rekindled my spirit. 1-2-3 get up, position yourself in the center, feel the wind, take a step back, pull the sail up from water, gently swerve into position and. Fall down flat belly up in the water. Repeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some zillion tries I finally did it. Wind on my sails, gently floated. Up the bay. Until of course the instructor was desperately waving at me &#8211; nami, nami. Out of syllabus word- got to decode from gestures. Too late. The swelling wave, nami in Japanese, pulled me down in no time. Back to beginning of Loop!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not too bad for a first time though. Especially given the fact that my IT career has foreclosed any options for exercise etc. it&#8217;s coffee not muscles that move me. So lack of balance, or being out of breath pretty quickly was not unexpected. Hell would Zuckerberg do any better? Well, he might, given his expertise in Asian language etc. atleast he could make sense when he was asked to pull the lever or lower the boom!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A day at Yokohama Chinatown Cosmo world and Yamashita park</h2>
<div id="attachment_1079" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1079" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009.jpg" alt="Random shots China Town " width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Random shots China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the early part of last century Japan was rapidly evolving into an industrial nation. Trade, import of raw material, export of engineered goods helped the port town of Yokohama grow into a major world city. the marine routes between Yokohama to Shanghai and Peking grew busy. This was the time some Chinese traders settled down near Yokohama port. A stone&#8217;s throw away from the harbor this settlement grew with establishment of school and temples. The wars affected life here badly, but finally as peace returned, the expat center came into its own. It was officially recognized as Chukagai or in English as Chinatown.</p>
<div id="attachment_1088" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1088" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010.jpg" alt="Glimpses China Town" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Glimpses China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently about 3-4000 people call this area home. Chinese crafts, bags, decor items, lanterns and memorabilia are available in plenty as are Chinese restaurants. For that authentic taste of Peking duck or dim sum you can head to any of the number of restaurants offering buffet choice.</p>
<div id="attachment_1078" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1078" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008.jpg" alt="Ever busy China Town" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ever busy China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chinese New Year is celebrated with grandeur. It&#8217;s a photographer&#8217;s delight with lantern decorations lion dance etc. And If interested you can also have your fortune read by experts in Chinese astrology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closest rail stations are &#8211; Motomachi Chukagai station on MinatoMirai line, Ishikawacho station on JR line, Yamashita pier by steamer from Yokohama station.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cosmo World amusement park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The giant Ferris wheel of Cosmo world is hard to miss. It&#8217;s in an estate boasting major office and shopping complexes, right at the harbor of Yokohama. Well connected by both land and sea routes, it is a children&#8217;s world in the day. And a showpiece in the night, when the lights are switched on. You can&#8217;t go very wrong if you decide to spend a few hours with kids here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole amusement park is divided into several zones. For kids, who would rather be busy with arcade games like beating the monkey or catching the fish. For growing ones, who may choose to get into a dolphin boat or say a penguin one and float around in a small indoor-type water canal. Folks willing to dare can go ride into a paddle powered coaster that runs around the park. Offers a beautiful view.</p>
<div id="attachment_1087" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1087" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002.jpg" alt="Cosmo world in a few shots" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cosmo world in a few shots</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1083" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1083" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003.jpg" alt="Paddle coaster ride at Cosmo World" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paddle coaster ride at Cosmo World</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1084" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1084" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005.jpg" alt="A range of rides at Cosmo World" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A range of rides at Cosmo World</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the ones really grown up there are quite a few rides. Such as a rotating dish that also slides up and down on a half moon track. Or a carousel with a central stand that slowly stands up as the carousel picks up pace. Yeah there is enough to spend a few hours of quality time, supplemented by shopping in the Queens towers shopping complex next door.</p>
<div id="attachment_1081" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1081" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001.jpg" alt="Queens Tower Shopping mall Yokohama" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Queens Tower Shopping mall Yokohama</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for ones planning to be there but rather enjoy the atmosphere, there is the adjacent old harbor turned into a city park. Some would find it similar to bay side developments in London. There is even a faux London bridge. And also an old sailing ship named Nippon Maru moored in concrete for ever. Not sure if similar to the original one it also carried tea from India!</p>
<div id="attachment_1074" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1074" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004.jpg" alt="Nippon Maru Park" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nippon Maru Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cosmo world children&#8217;s park closes early. But you can choose to hop into the giant Ferris wheel that lights up in the evening and enjoy the bay view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to reach Cosmo world from Yokohama would be via MinatoMirai line. Get down right at the MinatoMirai station. Or if you are like us you can choose to come by steamer from Yokohama.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you try to compare Cosmo World  with other children&#8217;s amusement park like Disney it will not be a fair comparison though. So expectations may need to be managed, if visiting with kids who have already been to Disney. For us this was the case. However once the kids got onto the rides all complaints were soon forgotten. As for us adults it was an alternative lighter on pocket leaving spare for some shopping next door!  Its a win win what do ya say?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Yamashita park Yokohama bay</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s one long pasture of green, with wide walking paths cutting through hedges and flower beds. Wooden benches under olden-days style street lamps. A road on one side separating it from the sea. That&#8217;s all that is Yamashita park.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the evening lights are switched on, the Cosmo world Ferris wheel in the distance and the yellow glow of the street lamps around create a dreamy ambience. Moist sea breeze sprays mist on people walking by the seaside. Evenings in summer see many town folks coming here spending a few hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd wanes as night comes, because this harbor area is somewhat far from residential corners. It borders the business district, the office and shopping malls that have come up in place of the old warehouses. Only the Chinatown is one residential area close by, a block away. So it is not unusual for couples leaving Yamashita park heading to Chinatown for dinner. When rest of the neighborhood settles down for the night Chinatown restaurants still stay awake.</p>
<div id="attachment_1090" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1090" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006.jpg" alt="Yamashita Park Yokohama" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yamashita Park Yokohama</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one other resident of this area that perhaps stay awake is the old ship Hikawa Maru. Now Retired permanently, docked at a pier at one end of Yamashita park. It was the pride of Japan in its heydays as the ocean liner ferrying the rich and the famous across Pacific.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marine Day celebrations at Yamashita Park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This daily routine takes a break though during the one day called Sparkling Twilight. It is the Yokohama annual summer festival day. Its a national holiday &#8211; Marine day. On this day Yamashita park fills in with crowd. A fair comes up on the grounds selling food and stuff. Live Art exhibitions are held. We saw how artists use chisel and hammer to carve a beautiful statue out of a solid block of ice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the day rolles into evening, lights come up on Hikawa Maru. Brilliantly lit Cosmo world Ferris wheel shines in the distance. Coast guard ships perform marine day parade, sailing in close to the harbor and blowing their horns as they pass by. At the preset time the horn on Hikawa Maru toots. Fireworks shoot up in a dazzling display. Night for this one day takes rest. At Yamashita Park.</p>
<div id="attachment_1085" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1085" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007.jpg" alt="Evening at Yamashita Park" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Evening at Yamashita Park</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Summer shinsui pools for kids in Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a common saying that childhood in Japan is the best while adult life in &#8230;. the dotted line portion of the sentence is often subject to debate but the first bit that is about childhood in Japan is not. And why not! Japan society celebrates youth to the extent that while rest of the world turns adult at 18 the Japanese do at 20. A straight 2 year extension! Sanctioned by government. Imagine then the pampering to the kids &#8211; the real actual kids. So no wonder there will be government facilities like shinsui parks for kids in Tokyo.</p>
<div id="attachment_1043" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1043" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/DOGGY00001-300x244.jpg" alt="Weight-segregated dog zones at Yoyogi park " width="300" height="244" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/DOGGY00001-300x244.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/DOGGY00001.jpg 617w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Weight-segregated dog zones at Yoyogi park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local municipalities build parks inside parks so that each group of kids can devote themselves to their age appropriate play. Mind you not just human kids but their best friend the pooches get the same treatment. So in pet parks there are separate play areas for the furry ones, 1-5 kgs, 5-10 kgs, etc etc. (The photo below was taken at Yoyogi park just in case you needed proof).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So it is only natural that for the tiny tots there will be separate swimming pools too, min-max age bracketed.  What merits a write up is the fact that such pools are often built inside public parks. And are maintained throughout the year for operation during the two months of summer. As July heat starts to bite, the toddlers can&#8217;t wait to get into their wading pools. Floats in all shapes and colors, parents in tow, the youngsters splash to their hearts content. Often starting in the shape of a fountain descending from hilltop the little stream snakes around boulders (made of rubber) and under bridges to finally merge into a lake. Depth maintained, cleanliness ensured these local pools for kids are known as Shinsui pools.</p>
<div id="attachment_1039" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1039 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00006-1-300x224.jpg" alt="fun at shinsui pool" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00006-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00006-1.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">fun at shinsui pool for kids in Tokyo</p></div>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Shinsui pools in Tokyo East</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Municipalities are rated on their performance everywhere. In some cities and countries its on quality of schools, sports facilities or healthcare. Tokyo municipalities have to report on their number and upkeep of Shinsui pools as well! No wonder in the recently-developed eastern part of Tokyo the Edogawa Koto area prided themselves on more number of Shinsui pools within their municipal areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Information on city pools parks and other facilities of Edogawa</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next time in summer if in Tokyo take your toddler to Shinsui pool in Kyosumi Sarue park, or Komatsugawa Funabori Shinsui pool, or the Nagisa park Shinsui pool or the Gyosen park one. Well there I pause. These are the ones I had the time so far to visit to, but there are many more. Discover yourself and have more fun!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note. In case you wanted some summer splash for yourself /your whole family, then read about Tokyo Water parks</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Canoeing at museum of maritime science Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Museum of maritime science at Odaiba is a complex combining both indoor and outdoor attractions. The main building itself is shaped like a giant ship. It houses exhibits on marine science especially on development of ocean transportation. But it has been undergoing repairs due to which it has very few exhibits at the moment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Soya Maru and the submersibles</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless the main attractions here perhaps lie outside, in the form of real ships, catamarans, submarines and submersibles. The permanently stationed Soya Maru is a research vessel that used to ply to the Antarctic. One can step in and explore the entire ship. The captain&#8217;s cabin, the officers cabins, the cabins and mess halls of non-officer staff, the engine room, the communication room, the top floor deck for helicopter landing, the lifeboats, the navigation room with its gyroscope tachometer telegraph anemometer radar and steering wheel all together create impression deep in the mind of a curious soul.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other exhibits like the submersibles also allow for having a first hand impression of how men and machines brave the elements in pursuit of science.</p>
<div id="attachment_1031" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1031" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00011.jpg" alt="View of Musuem of MaritimeScience from Yurikamome station" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00011.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00011-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View of Musuem of Maritime Science from Yurikamome station</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Canoeing for the very beginner</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The permanent exhibits aside Maritime museum also arranges seasonal activities like learning canoeing for kids, in its open pool. Mostly for free these activities offer a unique opportunity for kids to experience adventure and gain confidence in outdoor sports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That one day in summer team couchflyer happened to find themselves at the gates outside of the pool. The aquamarine pool is visible right from the platform of Yurikamome line Fune-no-go-kakukan station.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3243.3069328362935!2d139.77058111487918!3d35.620159140927015!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x60188a02105e20c7%3A0x2de0c3d7827b5e9!2z6Ii544Gu56eR5a2m6aSo!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1472991305698" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>We thought we were before time. But there were quite a few families with perhaps more eager kids. So we got our place in the queue snaking outside. The summer sun bore down on us. We stood wondering if all this was worth it.  But as the gates opened and the colorful canoes came into view all doubts disappeared.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Canoes,Sail boats, ready steady go</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were two seater and three seater canoes. Meant strictly for beginners the canoes always had one instructor on board. Then there were sail boats. Again intended to expose beginners to the pleasures of sail boating.  Keywords were beginners, and enjoyment. So age barely was a bar, ability was not questioned, parents were in fact encouraged to join in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1025" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1025" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00005.jpg" alt="Row row row your boat" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00005.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00005-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Row row row your boat</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Names of sailors were noted, boat type and possible in-time were distributed. We went out for a stroll next door at the museum.  But sailors in the team were in no mood to undergo lessons in geography and marine science. So we soon headed back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each team when called are given a quick theoretical lesson in how to oar. Oars matching heights of sailors were distributed. Everybody put on their life jackets. Sensei instructed which way to push the oar when intending to go left or right. Students followed. Heads nodded emphatically when asked so do you feel you can now canoe on your own?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The real fun</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When time came it was a different game altogether. Who knew water would be so hard to push? And as for the sail boats, managing wind and water at the same time seemed impossible!   Thankfully instructor on board was more than willing to lend a helping hand. So 15 minutes of theory and 15 minutes of practical later, a beaming posse of sailors reached shore.</p>
<div id="attachment_1022" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1022" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00001.jpg" alt="Sailor on his sail boat" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00001.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00001-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sailor on his sail boat</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Learning facilities abound</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In ocean bound Japan water sports is particularly popular. Each school has its own canoe club. And on 1st summer day every season the canoeing facilities are opened to every body to encourage beginners. Earlier we participated in such an open day in KueNakagawa river canoeing training area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/tokyo-water-sports-rowing-under-cherry-blossoms/" target="_blank">https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/tokyo-water-sports-rowing-under-cherry-blossoms/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the one difference,from that day to this one at Maritime Science center was that here the facility is in extremely clean shallow water. It is suitable for the very young ones as well. So if you have a superman planning to take a plunge,er learn to float in a canoe,  head straight for Maritime science. We are sure it will be a wanna do many time experience!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hikawa Maru and Marine day celebrations at Yokohama Harbor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On this Marine day we walked up the  bridge to Hikawa Maru, a storied ship anchored at Yokoyama harbor. Ships lately have rather gone into the territory of stories that start with once upon a time. It is hard to believe how these ships were the main mode of connect between continents till not so long ago. People traveled with entire entourage for the long voyages. It was like a city with all walks of people having their own wares and services and stories to tell. It is very difficult to realize for kids without really being inside one. This is the reason we planned to visit Hikawa Maru, the luxury liner of yesteryears. We chose Marine day holiday to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Marine day holiday is to remember the importance of ocean in Japans life and culture. In the port city of Yokohama Marine day is celebrated with annual Hanabi festival named Sparkling twilight. So it presented a good occasion to visit Yokohama and its harborside the Yamashita park. Hikawa Maru is anchored at one end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got down at JR Yokohama station. From there boarded a steamer heading to Yamashita park. Could have taken a bus or train. But that would be just so quick, so modern dayish. It had to feel like a day from those days.  So the steamer. We still did not know that the steamer ride on Marine day would offer us some really unique sights and experiences. Lets talk about that in a few minutes.</p>
<div id="attachment_982" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-982" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00004.jpg" alt="Coast guard demonstrations on Marine Day" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00004.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00004-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00004-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Coast guard demonstrations on Marine Day</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The steamer had an open deck and a separate glass covered AC sitting area. For a true feel chose the open deck. But it was hot,sultry, and we were city-bred tourists. So soon slunk back into the AC section.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marine Day Demonstrations by Port Authority</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a hoot and a bell the steamer started. Soon the glass buildings were left behind. The harbor bridge came into view, then moved afar. Yokohama Cosmo park played hide and seek with its Ferris wheel coming ever so close. Before the onslaught of air transport this was the heaving breathing center of activities in the east Japan. Even now the series of cranes, the dockyards full of containers, and distant shadows of ships anchored pointed to the importance of marine transport. The port authority handles a tremendous amount of cargo, exports from and imports into Japan and adds to Japan economy. So the operational readiness of this harbor is vital, entirely managed by the port authority. That day for marine day port authorities held special demonstrations of such readiness for us common people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we approached the pier, we could see a demonstration going on. A fire fighting ship was shooting water, as if extinguishing fire. Through its eight hose pipes it belched out huge siphons of water and mist.  The sprays were going up down swaying left to right, as if a powerful beast dancing creating a haze in its wake. We previously saw glimpses on TV how fire extinguishers work on burning container ships or oil rigs. But seeing it right in front was a different experience. That too from inside the steamer we got the closest view possible. And a few splashes too!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then coast guard helicopters took to their wings,  circling above. Next a flotilla of coast guard ships followed in. One after the other the ships sailed in close to the harbor, displaying a show of naval guard of honor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yamashita park was full of people coming for the marine day events. The park was decked up with a performance stage, eatery stalls, and flower arrangements. It was a special day for Yokohama, a city that boasted of a proud maritime history. Music, craft show, merry couple in kimono/yukata filled in the seaside.</p>
<div id="attachment_983" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-983" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00005.jpg" alt="Yamashita Park Yokohama Harbor" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00005.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yamashita Park Yokohama Harbor</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hikawa Maru</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But for us the attraction amongst all these was Hikawa Maru. The 12000 Tonne ocean liner that used to ferry the then richest of the rich across the Pacific. Before the 2nd world war, as industrial nations were increasingly competing for influence, large ocean liners were a statement of power and engineering prowess. In this environment Hikawa Maru was born, primed to uphold the prestige of Japan, the land of the rising sun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was docked in its own pier. A set of stairs and a bridge led to the 1st floor grand reception. A part of it is used now for ticket / souvenir dispensing. Past the ticket gate one enters the main hall. A movie introduces audience to various sections of the ship. And tells about the time in history the ship was built. One needs this to  appreciate why this enormous iron beast was built in the first place, and the role it played in the corridors of world power. Kids got their own booklet to put stamps on as they moved between the decks. This was their own logbook. Everything was there to kindle the feeling of the time and place one walked into.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We headed out of the reception hall into a long passage. It took us through the dining hall, the social room, the reading room, the smoking room, the lounge area. Each richly decorated with polished wooden floors, having leather sofa sets as furniture and glass chandeliers hanging above. The interiors were done by a then famous French designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walking past an open section in the corridor we entered the upper class cabin area. The cabins with beds, Almira, wash basin, draperies, writing table showed the grandiose lifestyle of these passengers. These were the richest of the rich of that time. Two stairs up one reached the captain&#8217;s chamber. The authority and prestige of the captain was supreme, conveyed through the series of room, guest rooms and in-room paraphernalia such as globes compass maps speedometer etc etc. Standing here the kids could start to relate to the stories of Titanic, captain Kid and others such.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One floor further up one reached the navigation room. Radar, telegraph machine, wind anemometer, the gyroscopes and the steering wheel made this room a super exploration room &#8211; a hub of whys what&#8217;s when and how&#8217;s. One had to try out the steering wheel, try hollering instructions through the speaking tube down to the engine room. After quite a while the little captain and big captain stepped out, satisfied. Yes there could not be just one captain with two siblings out there isnt it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next it was journey down into the hollow cavity of the ship where the giant engines once roared. A demo showed how combustion engines worked when a switch is pressed on. Not one but there were a series of engines in banks. Comparing such engines in a car with those on the ship, one could realize the enormity of the whole machine called ocean liner. Walking through the huge engine room it felt mysterious and too humongous. As if a Godzilla was there around us. We kind of rushed out. Out in the deck took a deep breath. The water below seemed so deep. Out here that giant engine was just a speck inside it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sparkling Twilight</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sea gulls sat in a queue on the iron chains. A swarm of Jellyfish were floating about. For us city folks we thought jelly fishes only appeared deep undersea, otherwise in aquariums. Seeing right next to us those outer worldly creatures was a new experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ship parade was still in full swing. The sun moved over to the horizon. Yachts joined in the parade with colorful lights lining their sails. Orange glow covered the western sky. It colored Hikawa Maru in its orange-yellow tinge. Evening was setting in.</p>
<div id="attachment_984" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-984" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00006.jpg" alt="Orange tinge of the setting sun" width="741" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00006.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00006-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Orange tinge of the setting sun</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_992" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-992" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00007.jpg" alt="Illuminated shoreline viewed from the harbor " width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HIKAWA00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Illuminated shoreline viewed from the harbor</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We walked along the seaside walkway. Ambled through manicured overhead garden, passed fountains with benches, finally loosened ourselves on the grass. The evening was slow, relaxing, with more and more people coming in filling up the park. Right on time the toot from Hokawa Maru signaled the beginning of Hanabi. A flurry of colors shot up lighting the dark sky in red blue yellow green and orange. It was a splendid day with a Sparkling night. And at one corner of it all Hikawa Maru stood en guard ready for one more glorious day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">SPOCHA The all you can play place in Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Millennials will love it here. Half real sports half video games, it offers enough excitement to spend a few hours. There is target shooting, kick boxing for the single players, air hockey table tennis badminton for the twos, bowling, basketball, volley ball, golf, billiards, frisbee for the larger groups. Games are time-limited usually 10 minutes. After one team finishes the next team waiting outside gets in after resetting the timer. This way you can move from one sports to another taking a taste of a variety without really spending all your energy in one. Floor to ceiling nets separate the courts and the audience. There are even auto- throw machines to improve your skills playing alone be it table tennis or baseball or golf</p>
<div id="attachment_947" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-947" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SPOCHA_8786.jpg" alt="SPOCHA- One player game Two Player games" width="270" height="540" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SPOCHA_8786.jpg 270w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SPOCHA_8786-150x300.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">SPOCHA- One player game Two Player games</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s all aimed at keeping folks engaged. Especially on a rainy day this entirely indoor sports complex is a boon. And for a party young at heart what better than book the facility for few hours and enjoy a team building timeout ! It need not be sports as in physical activities only. There are sets of video arcade games to join in the fight against space aliens or, just race against F1 drivers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the ones looking for more exotic fare why not try the bull ride! Or the new sensation of a Segway self balancing hover board! All you need is the interest rest all are there. You can rent skating shoes, you can change into freely available sports shoes, you can even get fresh towels and stuff from vending machines installed inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In case after all the activities you feel tired, or you just need that session of soulful singing to really let the blues away, there are a series of well appointed Karaoke rooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kids are welcome. Not only welcome but have their own facilities. For the toddlers there is a complete dedicated floor with play areas having ball play, tunnel crossing and what have you. For the little older tykes there is bowling, not to mention arcade games. What more there is even a space with optical projections &#8211; one can dance and jump and move the shadows to score a game !</p>
<div id="attachment_946" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-946" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SPOCHA_8787.jpg" alt="SPOCHA_for children too" width="540" height="540" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SPOCHA_8787.jpg 540w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SPOCHA_8787-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SPOCHA_8787-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">SPOCHA_for children too</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the kids enjoy what do their moms do? Worry not that&#8217;s also well thought of. How about letting oneself Into a massage chair, with a story book in hand? Next to the toddler play area there are rows of massage chairs, with rack full of books for reading. Sometimes one deserves a break like that isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this for a flat 2000 thousand yen or there about for 90 minutes, with discounts for school students and a little extra for next 90 minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interested? Look up the following link. It&#8217;s part of the franchise called Round1. They have branches all around, with author having visited the Odaiba one. Being in Odaiba a visit to the site can be combined with shopping at the fabulous shopping centers right there.   Need any more convincing?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">http://www.round1.co.jp/shop/tenpo/tokyo-divercity.html</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A point to note though &#8211; not being fluent in Japanese may disqualify you from some of the activities such as riding the Segway, apparently on safety ground, as it happened to us. Otherwise feel free to explore and enjoy to the max! Sports buffet -&gt; Spotcha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A family day out at Tokyo Inokashira park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinjuku has been a hub since the days the Emperor ruled all of Japan from Kyoto. His Samurai general set up base in Edo, the then Tokyo in East Japan. Couriers traveling from Kyoto to Tokyo would take rest at Shinjuku, order the papers, rehash the key message to be conveyed. In short the neighborhood here was more open to seeing folks come and go, host them for a few days. This tradition carried on into the modern era. Shinjuku sees three and a half million people pass by its railway station every day. The neighborhood grew into a densely packed but a more heterogeneous mix of cultures. Naturally the places around Shinjuku, Meguro, Ebisu, Shibuya turned into a foreigner hub. Not only people but the Meiji restoration era welcomed Western ideas and influences as well. So The traditional Koens so far familiar with Zen minimalism started seeing European garden designs.  Shinjuku Goen is one such new age classic, a national treasure now. In close proximity there is the Inokashira park, at Kichioji.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We visited Inokashira park this spring, in 2016. The road from the station to the park had many shops selling artsy items and ethnic knickknacks. The park itself is a nice mix of Western and Eastern styles. There is abundance of Poplars and weeping willows. Cherry blossoms come into their own in April. We missed the bloom period by a few weeks. But then the trees got covered in new green foliage, giving the entire horizon a lush green appearance all around. There were benches under the trees, by the side of the central boating lake.  Musicians were playing guitars, performers were showing magic to groups of kids , artists were displaying artwork. Decorated gas lights hung by the walkways crisscrossing the park.  Several bridges crossed the lake. A part of the park is separated out into a small zoo. The zoo houses a few varieties of birds, owls, cranes and small mammals like hedgehogs. There is a petting area as well.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_898" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-898" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001.jpg" alt="The paths inside Inokashira" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The paths inside Inokashira</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road heading right inside the park divides into several arterial paths. The main one takes a circular walk around the lake. Others branch into secluded areas good for seating for a while, or towards the zoo or the Ghibli studio.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking anti clockwise  taking the main road, one goes past the bridge connecting to the boating pier, the zoo and leads to the Benzaiten temple. Benzaiten is Japanese form of Goddess Saraswati, Vedic God for arts and literature. A little vermilion color bridge heads out from the temple connecting back on to the main walkway. The road goes past another one or two bridges, by a set of benches under the green leaves, going past a few coffee / ice cream shops, and circles back to the opposite end of the park. There are fountains in the midst of the lake, spraying mist that partly covers the area, making some like the view while others may rue the modern invasion  into an otherwise sedate country scenery. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_897" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-897" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003.jpg" alt="Benzaiten, Inokashira Park" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Benzaiten, Inokashira Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right in the middle of the park, at the area in front of the boating pier there are a few table and Chairs, a seating area, and rest rooms. There is also an entrance to the zoo here. Coffee and ice cream shops beckon a few steps away from here, across the main path heading out from the boating pier. The entire area around here has an English countryside feel. Especially the Rowing boats anchored at a side, the ice cream and coffee shops under the poplars and weeping willows may remind one of Peak District, Derby shire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further onward from the coffee shops walking still anticlockwise one approaches the end where the lake narrows into a small stream. There&#8217;s a little swan house, you can find the owners heading home if you happen to be here towards evening. A kiddy park with slides and swing is there at this end. The road curves back, with the embankment beside the lake being wider here. Artists performers and sundry entertainers set up their wares here.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_900" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-900" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005.jpg" alt="Away from it all right in the middle of the city" width="681" height="468" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005.jpg 681w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005-130x90.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Away from it all right in the middle of the city</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lake, the trees and the multicultural ambiance all added to the real estate value around the park. Single and two storied houses on the two sides of the approach road do look posh. And even the mansions on the other three sides surrounding the park having apartments balconies opening to the park also appear premium. No doubt it is a luxury to be living in such a place. But for us casual visitors also, there&#8217;s enough to do, take in and carry back home in the form of a well spent few hours. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrance to the park is free. Do follow the link to find more details on the park opening times, latest events and access information.</span></p>
