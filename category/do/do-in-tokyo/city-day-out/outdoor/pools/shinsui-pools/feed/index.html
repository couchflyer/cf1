				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Summer shinsui pools for kids in Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a common saying that childhood in Japan is the best while adult life in &#8230;. the dotted line portion of the sentence is often subject to debate but the first bit that is about childhood in Japan is not. And why not! Japan society celebrates youth to the extent that while rest of the world turns adult at 18 the Japanese do at 20. A straight 2 year extension! Sanctioned by government. Imagine then the pampering to the kids &#8211; the real actual kids. So no wonder there will be government facilities like shinsui parks for kids in Tokyo.</p>
<div id="attachment_1043" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1043" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/DOGGY00001-300x244.jpg" alt="Weight-segregated dog zones at Yoyogi park " width="300" height="244" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/DOGGY00001-300x244.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/DOGGY00001.jpg 617w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Weight-segregated dog zones at Yoyogi park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local municipalities build parks inside parks so that each group of kids can devote themselves to their age appropriate play. Mind you not just human kids but their best friend the pooches get the same treatment. So in pet parks there are separate play areas for the furry ones, 1-5 kgs, 5-10 kgs, etc etc. (The photo below was taken at Yoyogi park just in case you needed proof).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So it is only natural that for the tiny tots there will be separate swimming pools too, min-max age bracketed. Â What merits a write up is the fact that such pools are often built inside public parks. And are maintained throughout the year for operation during the two months of summer. As July heat starts to bite, the toddlers can&#8217;t wait to get into their wading pools. Floats in all shapes and colors, parents in tow, the youngsters splash to their hearts content. Often starting in the shape of a fountain descending from hilltop the little stream snakes around boulders (made of rubber) and under bridges to finally merge into a lake. Depth maintained, cleanliness ensured these local pools for kids are known as Shinsui pools.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Shinsui pools in Tokyo East</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Municipalities are rated on their performance everywhere. In some cities and countries its on quality of schools, sports facilities or healthcare. Tokyo municipalities have to report on their number and upkeep of Shinsui pools as well! No wonder in the recently-developed eastern part of Tokyo the Edogawa Koto area prided themselves on more number of Shinsui pools within their municipal areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Information on city pools parks and other facilities of Edogawa</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next time in summer if in Tokyo take your toddler to Shinsui pool in Kyosumi Sarue park, or Komatsugawa Funabori Shinsui pool, or the Nagisa park Shinsui pool or the Gyosen park one. Well there I pause. These are the ones I had the time so far to visit to, but there are many more. Discover yourself and have more fun!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note. In case you wanted some summer splash for yourself /your whole family, then read about Tokyo Water parks</p>
