				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Canoeing at museum of maritime science Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Museum of maritime science at Odaiba is a complex combining both indoor and outdoor attractions. The main building itself is shaped like a giant ship. It houses exhibits on marine science especially on development of ocean transportation. But it has been undergoing repairs due to which it has very few exhibits at the moment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Soya Maru and the submersibles</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless the main attractions here perhaps lie outside, in the form of real ships, catamarans, submarines and submersibles. The permanently stationed Soya Maru is a research vessel that used to ply to the Antarctic. One can step in and explore the entire ship. The captain&#8217;s cabin, the officers cabins, the cabins and mess halls of non-officer staff, the engine room, the communication room, the top floor deck for helicopter landing, the lifeboats, the navigation room with its gyroscope tachometer telegraph anemometer radar and steering wheel all together create impression deep in the mind of a curious soul.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other exhibits like the submersibles also allow for having a first hand impression of how men and machines brave the elements in pursuit of science.</p>
<div id="attachment_1031" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1031" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00011.jpg" alt="View of Musuem of MaritimeScience from Yurikamome station" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00011.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00011-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View of Musuem of Maritime Science from Yurikamome station</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Canoeing for the very beginner</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The permanent exhibits aside Maritime museum also arranges seasonal activities like learning canoeing for kids, in its open pool. Mostly for free these activities offer a unique opportunity for kids to experience adventure and gain confidence in outdoor sports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That one day in summer team couchflyer happened to find themselves at the gates outside of the pool. The aquamarine pool is visible right from the platform of Yurikamome line Fune-no-go-kakukan station.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3243.3069328362935!2d139.77058111487918!3d35.620159140927015!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x60188a02105e20c7%3A0x2de0c3d7827b5e9!2z6Ii544Gu56eR5a2m6aSo!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1472991305698" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>We thought we were before time. But there were quite a few families with perhaps more eager kids. So we got our place in the queue snaking outside. The summer sun bore down on us. We stood wondering if all this was worth it.  But as the gates opened and the colorful canoes came into view all doubts disappeared.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Canoes,Sail boats, ready steady go</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were two seater and three seater canoes. Meant strictly for beginners the canoes always had one instructor on board. Then there were sail boats. Again intended to expose beginners to the pleasures of sail boating.  Keywords were beginners, and enjoyment. So age barely was a bar, ability was not questioned, parents were in fact encouraged to join in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1025" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1025" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00005.jpg" alt="Row row row your boat" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00005.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00005-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Row row row your boat</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Names of sailors were noted, boat type and possible in-time were distributed. We went out for a stroll next door at the museum.  But sailors in the team were in no mood to undergo lessons in geography and marine science. So we soon headed back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each team when called are given a quick theoretical lesson in how to oar. Oars matching heights of sailors were distributed. Everybody put on their life jackets. Sensei instructed which way to push the oar when intending to go left or right. Students followed. Heads nodded emphatically when asked so do you feel you can now canoe on your own?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The real fun</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When time came it was a different game altogether. Who knew water would be so hard to push? And as for the sail boats, managing wind and water at the same time seemed impossible!   Thankfully instructor on board was more than willing to lend a helping hand. So 15 minutes of theory and 15 minutes of practical later, a beaming posse of sailors reached shore.</p>
<div id="attachment_1022" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1022" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00001.jpg" alt="Sailor on his sail boat" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00001.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/CANOE00001-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sailor on his sail boat</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Learning facilities abound</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In ocean bound Japan water sports is particularly popular. Each school has its own canoe club. And on 1st summer day every season the canoeing facilities are opened to every body to encourage beginners. Earlier we participated in such an open day in KueNakagawa river canoeing training area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/tokyo-water-sports-rowing-under-cherry-blossoms/" target="_blank">https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/tokyo-water-sports-rowing-under-cherry-blossoms/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the one difference,from that day to this one at Maritime Science center was that here the facility is in extremely clean shallow water. It is suitable for the very young ones as well. So if you have a superman planning to take a plunge,er learn to float in a canoe,  head straight for Maritime science. We are sure it will be a wanna do many time experience!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This 10th April was the annual spring open day at Edogawa Rowing Club.  Winter is gone. Colorful boats were floating gently in the spring breeze under the mellow sun. Viewers gathered around the river side in tents under the cherry blossom trees.</p>
<h2>Edogawa &#8211; center for Tokyo Water Sports</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Edogawa was a low lying area, riverine marshy land. In terms of industry there were log factories, boat building, fishing. Funabori railway station was a dock. Government revenue department had its customs checkpoint set up here. It&#8217;s a museum now.</p>
<div id="attachment_846" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-846 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-300x300.jpg" alt="Rowing under cherry blossoms" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rowing under cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Urbanization has changed much of this eastern fringe of old Tokyo. But some traditions lived on. Boating or its modern versions like rowing canoeing speed boating water scootering have taken the place. Aided by newly set up  lock gates and jetties the Kyu Nakagawa canal has transformed into a water sports enthusiasts training ground. School rowing and canoeing clubs set up tents on Sundays. So do the members of local rowing/canoeing clubs. Any body can be a member, age no bar. In fact the ever growing fitness craze among even longer living Japanese population sees a lot of grey haired men and women as members. Youngsters from the age of 12 (middle school/ Chu Gakkou ) can take to their own canoes. The school club members practice speed rowing in batches. Most club equipments such as boats / canoes / oars are kept in two storage areas under the two foot bridges connecting Komatsugawa and Ojima. Individual enthusiasts with their own row boats / inflatables  are also welcome. Cars with boats tugged behind or secured on top can park in a neighborhood car parking in Komatsugawa park.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Annual Spring Open Day &#8211; rowing under the cherry blossoms</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local clubs start their annual season every Spring. On a set day all clubs descend on to the area between the two bridges setting up tents, and information kiosks. New members are welcome to join. To help people experience the fun, the clubs offer free 30 minutes try it yourself offers. Each club has its own specialty. Some have row boats, some canoes, some rubber dinghies and others with wooden traditional ones. At one end competitions are held between club members. The competition boats are long traditional dragon boats with one yeoman playing a drum. The competitors in their team colors row their long boats in unison with the yeomans rhythm. Members friends and families cheer from under their tents by the river side.</p>
<div id="attachment_847" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-847" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-300x300.jpg" alt="Row boats and dragon boats for racing" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Row boats and dragon boats for racing</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comparatively the introductory rides for new members bring in a different kind of excitement. Mainly crowded by just-attained middle school kids and their parents, it is a chance to test one&#8217;s abilities in water sports. Senior citizens with enthusiasm for new challenges also step in. Life vest, brief training, and assistance in water is provided by the club members.</p>
<div id="attachment_842" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-842" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004-300x230.jpg" alt="Learners queue up " width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Learners queue up</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event timing being in spring, cherry blossom trees in bloom greet day&#8217;s visitors. The cherry blossoms, the colorful tents, carbon fiber boats and the cheerful crowd make for a festive day atmosphere. Food carts with tako yaki, and kaki gori complete the ambiance.</p>
