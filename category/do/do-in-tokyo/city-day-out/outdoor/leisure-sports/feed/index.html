<h3>Tree Climbing as a sport arrives in Tokyo</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are everywhere &#8211; clambering up, swaying from a branch, or just hanging. Waving at the viewers below. Boys and girls, young or err no so young. Everybody trying their hands, and legs, at tree climbing as this latest craze hits Tokyo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days when one would scan  the neighborhood trees for ripe fruits on the way to school. And launch assault on the way back. Cuts and bruises were part of the game. The odd broken limb was when things didn&#8217;t work to plan. That was it, simple pleasures of simple times.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But times changed. Sophistication has changed the approach if not the urge.  Apparently tree climbing  is still fun. Lots of fun. Provided you are part of a registered organization with necessary safety gear and licenses to operate. It&#8217;s a recognized sport. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1217"></span></p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Tree climbing as a sport evolved first in the Wild West. There is a Wikipedia  entry as well. It kinda says tree climbing evolved even before there was internet! Back in the nineteen hundred and eighties! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has gained popularity recently. Now there is an international governing body &#8211; Tree Climbers Internal Inc. (TCI) With branches in USA Canada UK Australia Malaysia China Japan Indonesia etc. Global Organization of Tree Climbers (GOTC) is mandated with the task of framing standards and certifying local bodies. After all it involves all the nitty gritties of mountain climbing, with climbing-harnesses, carabiners, and an assorted bunch of ropes being tools of the trade. One needs to learn various knots frequently used is mountaineering such as Munter Hitch, Prussic Knots and others such. Helmet, gloves and eye protection glasses are also needed, in case you wondered. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is it really like</strong><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s really not that difficult after all. At least that is what one felt having attended one such climbing session recently held in Tokyo. Kids lined up grouped into batches for a two hour session each. In this session they were introduced to the techniques of how to climb up, and belay down, with the assortment of ropes and knots already set up for them by the organizers Tree Climbing Japan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK let&#8217;s take a close look. The rule book  requires one to first find a tree with sturdy branches. Then Get under one branch  that does not have leaves obstructing the way up. Aim high and fling a rope long enough to coil around the branch and come hanging down. Pull it tight. Fix one end of the rope with a weight. And  attach a carabiner at the other end. Take a smaller rope, fix one end to the same carabiner and another end to the longer rope knotted in such a way that it can move up or down. This is the cord that will help you get up or down. Move the knot up, it pulls you up. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Knots and hitches</strong><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here the trick is in how you tie this knot. It&#8217;s called a Prusic knot. When slack it can be moved up or down sliding on the main rope. But if there&#8217;s a pull then it tightly clutches the rope. When you fix the carabiner to your harness, and push the Prusic knot up, you are basically hanging down from this knot. If this were not gripping the main rope tightly enough you would slide down. So the better is the knot, the safer you are. To be extra safe climbers tie additional knots on the main rope that can work as a break  in case somehow the Prusic knot fails to hold. These breaks are tied at intervals as the climber goes up. And untied with a pull on the way back down. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Pushing up </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To push up you use a cord as foot board. It one smaller cord that is tied a little below the Prusic knot. This also is a Prusic knot, a smaller one  that can slide up or down the main rope. It is tied together at the two ends so that it forms a loop. This is the foot rest. Climber pushes on the foot rest to go up. Then loosens the main knot and pushes that up. It is the next stop where the climbers weight will hold it tight. Next the climber pulls the foot rest up, pushes it down with his foot. This rope works as a ladder for him. He steps on it to lift himself up. Then again he moves the main knot once more upwards. And follows this motion to climb up all the way to the branch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">This 10th April was the annual spring open day at Edogawa Rowing Club.  Winter is gone. Colorful boats were floating gently in the spring breeze under the mellow sun. Viewers gathered around the river side in tents under the cherry blossom trees.</p>
<h2>Edogawa &#8211; center for Tokyo Water Sports</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Edogawa was a low lying area, riverine marshy land. In terms of industry there were log factories, boat building, fishing. Funabori railway station was a dock. Government revenue department had its customs checkpoint set up here. It&#8217;s a museum now.</p>
<div id="attachment_846" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-846 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-300x300.jpg" alt="Rowing under cherry blossoms" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rowing under cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Urbanization has changed much of this eastern fringe of old Tokyo. But some traditions lived on. Boating or its modern versions like rowing canoeing speed boating water scootering have taken the place. Aided by newly set up  lock gates and jetties the Kyu Nakagawa canal has transformed into a water sports enthusiasts training ground. School rowing and canoeing clubs set up tents on Sundays. So do the members of local rowing/canoeing clubs. Any body can be a member, age no bar. In fact the ever growing fitness craze among even longer living Japanese population sees a lot of grey haired men and women as members. Youngsters from the age of 12 (middle school/ Chu Gakkou ) can take to their own canoes. The school club members practice speed rowing in batches. Most club equipments such as boats / canoes / oars are kept in two storage areas under the two foot bridges connecting Komatsugawa and Ojima. Individual enthusiasts with their own row boats / inflatables  are also welcome. Cars with boats tugged behind or secured on top can park in a neighborhood car parking in Komatsugawa park.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Annual Spring Open Day &#8211; rowing under the cherry blossoms</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local clubs start their annual season every Spring. On a set day all clubs descend on to the area between the two bridges setting up tents, and information kiosks. New members are welcome to join. To help people experience the fun, the clubs offer free 30 minutes try it yourself offers. Each club has its own specialty. Some have row boats, some canoes, some rubber dinghies and others with wooden traditional ones. At one end competitions are held between club members. The competition boats are long traditional dragon boats with one yeoman playing a drum. The competitors in their team colors row their long boats in unison with the yeomans rhythm. Members friends and families cheer from under their tents by the river side.</p>
<div id="attachment_847" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-847" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-300x300.jpg" alt="Row boats and dragon boats for racing" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Row boats and dragon boats for racing</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comparatively the introductory rides for new members bring in a different kind of excitement. Mainly crowded by just-attained middle school kids and their parents, it is a chance to test one&#8217;s abilities in water sports. Senior citizens with enthusiasm for new challenges also step in. Life vest, brief training, and assistance in water is provided by the club members.</p>
<div id="attachment_842" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-842" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004-300x230.jpg" alt="Learners queue up " width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Learners queue up</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event timing being in spring, cherry blossom trees in bloom greet day&#8217;s visitors. The cherry blossoms, the colorful tents, carbon fiber boats and the cheerful crowd make for a festive day atmosphere. Food carts with tako yaki, and kaki gori complete the ambiance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it&#8217;s cold outside, and windy, and you are alone at home, you can still enjoy the time. No I am not saying to lazily watch TV. You can actually go enjoy engaging in sports, right in the neighborhood. You don&#8217;t even have to be a member of any formal sports club. Don&#8217;t need to make any appointment. Don&#8217;t need any gears. Yes You can go walk into any of the ice skating rinks around in town. Just go Ice Skating in Tokyo. In Roppongi Midtown, or Akasaka Sakas, in Harajuku or such many places . There are both outdoor and indoor facilities. Some are permanent, open all year round. Some like the one in Akasaka open only during the winter season.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When people in colorful woolens glide across the ice white rink, Christmas music playing in the background, its like the Disney movies. Its hard not to join in, even if skating is not truly ones core skill. You can have trainers train you. And you need not even spend a fortune for it. Well, you may not even spend a penny, to be precise, provided you are at the right place at right time. There are city council run ice skating rinks in Tokyo that offer free training on selected days/time. Very friendly to beginners. Interested? Then read on.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Edogawa Sports Land</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One Sunday morning a couple of weeks back, we decided to go for skating. Newbies that we were, we went for a council run facility in Eastern fringe of Tokyo. Known as Edogawa sports land, it is on Toei Shinjuku subway line, easily reachable by short bus trip from Shinozaki or Mizue station. It is inside a new and expansive sports complex building. The rink converts into a swimming pool in summer and offers skating in winter. Buses are frequent. Get down, walk in, buy your ticket from the ticket vending machine, pick up your size shoes from the well stocked facility, go to the locker room, pick up a helmet if you so please at the entrance to the rink, and there you are &#8211; all set to skate. Easy as 1-2-3.</p>
<div id="attachment_676" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-676" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005-300x300.jpg" alt="We are skating yaay " width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We are skating yaay</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were people of all ages and skills trying their hand, err feet, in ice skating. Not surprisingly there were some nimble young belle skating with all the moves one sees on TV. Well well, if we had time on our side we also could do it. Its ice right? So just step in, and voila, you start sliding! That&#8217;s what we thought. Things were not that easy though, to be honest. Gravity seemed to have a particular liking for us, making us hit the ground time and again. Nevertheless, that&#8217;s part of the game. There was that old gentleman skating deftly past us effortlessly. Inspiration. Never give up, we told ourselves. There were indeed some folks with amazing skills, and there were newbies. Like us many people walked in, just to enjoy skating.</p>
<div id="attachment_679" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-679" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00002-300x230.jpg" alt="Glowing in joy" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00002-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00002.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Glowing in joy</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got time to rest as a bell rang. A big roller moved in, to smoothen the ice. Rest was well deserved indeed, given the number of falls in a span of 30 or 40 minutes. But we were eager to jump right back in as the bell rang again. It&#8217;s as long as you want for one entry pass. Refreshment facilities were well thought of. One can have either lunch or snacks from the attached refreshment area. There were hot fried chips, sausages, smoking hot curry rice from the cafeteria. There was even a food vending machine by the side, that served ready hot ramen!  For someone picky however, who feels that in the cold surroundings cold food gels better, that is there too. We actually indulged in Belgian ice creams, during one of the breaks. Served again by vending machines standing by. And then had freshly brewed coffee in the next break! Overall the time was well-spent, thoroughly enjoyed. Whenever felt tad bit too cold, feeling like needing a break from skating, to let the frozen toes heal, headed into the heated rest area. Chilled a bit, mean soaked the heat, and then came back in to blaze a trail&#8230;.kind of.</p>
