				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kyosumi Garden One Traditional Japanese Garden In Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best traditional Japanese styles garden in Tokyo is in this sleepy east part of Tokyo, Kyosumi Garden. Once it was a private garden, belonging to Mitsubishi group. In the Meiji era this was the property of Mitsubishi patriarch Kinokuniya San. From then till now &#8211; over last close to hundred and fifty years this area of Tokyo has undergone a sea change. But this one garden has been well preserved under care of Mitsubishi group. Being accessible only to company high ranking officials and their guests this garden maintained its originality, oblivious of all the rapid changes happening around.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3240.8507755459514!2d139.79561561491894!3d35.680676180194375!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6018893e17559757%3A0xf238b51ea3c37819!2sKiyosumi+Garden!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1475903959614" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was built around a central pond, with wooden bridges, tea house, undulating small hills and valleys, forests full of Japanese pines, maples,  junipers, and bamboo groves. Stone steps led to the bridge below an artificial waterfall. Water worn old stones having specific religious bearings were shipped in from distant places around Japan and positioned carefully in the landscape. The ambiance is still there.</p>
<div id="attachment_1098" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1098" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg" alt="One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it&#8217;s maintained by local government. For a minimal entry fee charged. It&#8217;s a few minutes walk from Toei Oedo line or Hanzomon line Kyosumi Shirakawa station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being somewhat away from the city center and key tourist attractions, the surroundings still bear the distant old Japan look. No Mc burgers, save for Denny&#8217;s if you plan for a lunch nearby. Neither too many Izakayas &#8211; the Japanese restaurants.. Traditional residential area. Shops still actually sell fresh veg produce in wooden baskets!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The walking route</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once inside you might like to follow the Arrow pointing towards the walking route. If you don&#8217;t though, you won&#8217;t be lost since there&#8217;s not many paths to choose from anyway. Walk towards the central pond, keep walking around anti clockwise. Go Past the walkway made of stone slabs. Step Across the bridge. Make your way over the stones underneath which the goldfish and the turtles laze around. Take the walk up the small tree-covered slope. Take your time. The view from here encompasses the entire water body surrounded by the green hills with a central tea room. The entire panorama in one frame. There are benches for the ones wishing to take the view in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1096" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1096" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg" alt="Panoramic view point" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Panoramic view point</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path goes further ahead passing around the tea room. It&#8217;s restricted access no peeking around please. The walkway divides. An adjacent garden comes into view. There is a wooden pavilion, and several wooden barbecue style tables. Good for taking a bento break. This area is sometimes used by those modern yoga healing classes.</p>
<div id="attachment_1099" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1099" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg" alt="The creek of Pines" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The creek of Pines</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walk Back</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From here visitors head back to the walking course that snakes behind the tea room and heads towards a narrow creek. Gold Fishes crowd around the creek. A few weather worn stones, with Japanese maples cedars and ferns growing around them create an image of a land far off. Pristine. Where waterfalls glisten in the morning sunshine, gurgling down the quiet valley. Curiously a stork some day found its way here, and since called this place home.</p>
<div id="attachment_1100" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1100" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg" alt="Time for a break" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Time for a break</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pathway past this point again starts going up.  Turns left once the Stone lamp stand comes into view. A lane goes straight ahead, heading towards the lily beds. Another forks left towards a green island, past a small bridge.</p>
<div id="attachment_1103" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1103 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg" alt="The bridge towards the central island" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The bridge towards the central island</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1102" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1102" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg" alt="A hazy winter morning" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A hazy winter morning</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The walk ends at a traditional ryokan style hall, glass  covered, with extended wooden patio. The grass lawn and the pebbled walkways merge back where the arrow said Start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Autumn is said to be the best time to enjoy this park. It&#8217;s amongst one of the sites to enjoy Fall colors right in Tokyo. At other times also, it does not fail to impress. A break from the civilized world for a couple of hours. Priceless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A day at Yokohama Chinatown Cosmo world and Yamashita park</h2>
<div id="attachment_1079" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1079" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009.jpg" alt="Random shots China Town " width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Random shots China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the early part of last century Japan was rapidly evolving into an industrial nation. Trade, import of raw material, export of engineered goods helped the port town of Yokohama grow into a major world city. the marine routes between Yokohama to Shanghai and Peking grew busy. This was the time some Chinese traders settled down near Yokohama port. A stone&#8217;s throw away from the harbor this settlement grew with establishment of school and temples. The wars affected life here badly, but finally as peace returned, the expat center came into its own. It was officially recognized as Chukagai or in English as Chinatown.</p>
<div id="attachment_1088" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1088" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010.jpg" alt="Glimpses China Town" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Glimpses China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently about 3-4000 people call this area home. Chinese crafts, bags, decor items, lanterns and memorabilia are available in plenty as are Chinese restaurants. For that authentic taste of Peking duck or dim sum you can head to any of the number of restaurants offering buffet choice.</p>
<div id="attachment_1078" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1078" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008.jpg" alt="Ever busy China Town" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00008-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ever busy China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chinese New Year is celebrated with grandeur. It&#8217;s a photographer&#8217;s delight with lantern decorations lion dance etc. And If interested you can also have your fortune read by experts in Chinese astrology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closest rail stations are &#8211; Motomachi Chukagai station on MinatoMirai line, Ishikawacho station on JR line, Yamashita pier by steamer from Yokohama station.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cosmo World amusement park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The giant Ferris wheel of Cosmo world is hard to miss. It&#8217;s in an estate boasting major office and shopping complexes, right at the harbor of Yokohama. Well connected by both land and sea routes, it is a children&#8217;s world in the day. And a showpiece in the night, when the lights are switched on. You can&#8217;t go very wrong if you decide to spend a few hours with kids here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole amusement park is divided into several zones. For kids, who would rather be busy with arcade games like beating the monkey or catching the fish. For growing ones, who may choose to get into a dolphin boat or say a penguin one and float around in a small indoor-type water canal. Folks willing to dare can go ride into a paddle powered coaster that runs around the park. Offers a beautiful view.</p>
<div id="attachment_1087" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1087" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002.jpg" alt="Cosmo world in a few shots" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cosmo world in a few shots</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1083" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1083" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003.jpg" alt="Paddle coaster ride at Cosmo World" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paddle coaster ride at Cosmo World</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1084" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1084" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005.jpg" alt="A range of rides at Cosmo World" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A range of rides at Cosmo World</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the ones really grown up there are quite a few rides. Such as a rotating dish that also slides up and down on a half moon track. Or a carousel with a central stand that slowly stands up as the carousel picks up pace. Yeah there is enough to spend a few hours of quality time, supplemented by shopping in the Queens towers shopping complex next door.</p>
<div id="attachment_1081" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1081" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001.jpg" alt="Queens Tower Shopping mall Yokohama" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Queens Tower Shopping mall Yokohama</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for ones planning to be there but rather enjoy the atmosphere, there is the adjacent old harbor turned into a city park. Some would find it similar to bay side developments in London. There is even a faux London bridge. And also an old sailing ship named Nippon Maru moored in concrete for ever. Not sure if similar to the original one it also carried tea from India!</p>
<div id="attachment_1074" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1074" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004.jpg" alt="Nippon Maru Park" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nippon Maru Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cosmo world children&#8217;s park closes early. But you can choose to hop into the giant Ferris wheel that lights up in the evening and enjoy the bay view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to reach Cosmo world from Yokohama would be via MinatoMirai line. Get down right at the MinatoMirai station. Or if you are like us you can choose to come by steamer from Yokohama.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you try to compare Cosmo World  with other children&#8217;s amusement park like Disney it will not be a fair comparison though. So expectations may need to be managed, if visiting with kids who have already been to Disney. For us this was the case. However once the kids got onto the rides all complaints were soon forgotten. As for us adults it was an alternative lighter on pocket leaving spare for some shopping next door!  Its a win win what do ya say?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Yamashita park Yokohama bay</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s one long pasture of green, with wide walking paths cutting through hedges and flower beds. Wooden benches under olden-days style street lamps. A road on one side separating it from the sea. That&#8217;s all that is Yamashita park.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the evening lights are switched on, the Cosmo world Ferris wheel in the distance and the yellow glow of the street lamps around create a dreamy ambience. Moist sea breeze sprays mist on people walking by the seaside. Evenings in summer see many town folks coming here spending a few hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd wanes as night comes, because this harbor area is somewhat far from residential corners. It borders the business district, the office and shopping malls that have come up in place of the old warehouses. Only the Chinatown is one residential area close by, a block away. So it is not unusual for couples leaving Yamashita park heading to Chinatown for dinner. When rest of the neighborhood settles down for the night Chinatown restaurants still stay awake.</p>
<div id="attachment_1090" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1090" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006.jpg" alt="Yamashita Park Yokohama" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yamashita Park Yokohama</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one other resident of this area that perhaps stay awake is the old ship Hikawa Maru. Now Retired permanently, docked at a pier at one end of Yamashita park. It was the pride of Japan in its heydays as the ocean liner ferrying the rich and the famous across Pacific.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marine Day celebrations at Yamashita Park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This daily routine takes a break though during the one day called Sparkling Twilight. It is the Yokohama annual summer festival day. Its a national holiday &#8211; Marine day. On this day Yamashita park fills in with crowd. A fair comes up on the grounds selling food and stuff. Live Art exhibitions are held. We saw how artists use chisel and hammer to carve a beautiful statue out of a solid block of ice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the day rolles into evening, lights come up on Hikawa Maru. Brilliantly lit Cosmo world Ferris wheel shines in the distance. Coast guard ships perform marine day parade, sailing in close to the harbor and blowing their horns as they pass by. At the preset time the horn on Hikawa Maru toots. Fireworks shoot up in a dazzling display. Night for this one day takes rest. At Yamashita Park.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A family day out at Tokyo Inokashira park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinjuku has been a hub since the days the Emperor ruled all of Japan from Kyoto. His Samurai general set up base in Edo, the then Tokyo in East Japan. Couriers traveling from Kyoto to Tokyo would take rest at Shinjuku, order the papers, rehash the key message to be conveyed. In short the neighborhood here was more open to seeing folks come and go, host them for a few days. This tradition carried on into the modern era. Shinjuku sees three and a half million people pass by its railway station every day. The neighborhood grew into a densely packed but a more heterogeneous mix of cultures. Naturally the places around Shinjuku, Meguro, Ebisu, Shibuya turned into a foreigner hub. Not only people but the Meiji restoration era welcomed Western ideas and influences as well. So The traditional Koens so far familiar with Zen minimalism started seeing European garden designs.  Shinjuku Goen is one such new age classic, a national treasure now. In close proximity there is the Inokashira park, at Kichioji.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_896" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-896" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00002.jpg" alt="A family day out at Tokyo Inokashira Park" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00002.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A family day out at Tokyo Inokashira Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We visited Inokashira park this spring, in 2016. The road from the station to the park had many shops selling artsy items and ethnic knickknacks. The park itself is a nice mix of Western and Eastern styles. There is abundance of Poplars and weeping willows. Cherry blossoms come into their own in April. We missed the bloom period by a few weeks. But then the trees got covered in new green foliage, giving the entire horizon a lush green appearance all around. There were benches under the trees, by the side of the central boating lake.  Musicians were playing guitars, performers were showing magic to groups of kids , artists were displaying artwork. Decorated gas lights hung by the walkways crisscrossing the park.  Several bridges crossed the lake. A part of the park is separated out into a small zoo. The zoo houses a few varieties of birds, owls, cranes and small mammals like hedgehogs. There is a petting area as well.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_898" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-898" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001.jpg" alt="The paths inside Inokashira" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00001-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The paths inside Inokashira</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road heading right inside the park divides into several arterial paths. The main one takes a circular walk around the lake. Others branch into secluded areas good for seating for a while, or towards the zoo or the Ghibli studio.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking anti clockwise  taking the main road, one goes past the bridge connecting to the boating pier, the zoo and leads to the Benzaiten temple. Benzaiten is Japanese form of Goddess Saraswati, Vedic God for arts and literature. A little vermilion color bridge heads out from the temple connecting back on to the main walkway. The road goes past another one or two bridges, by a set of benches under the green leaves, going past a few coffee / ice cream shops, and circles back to the opposite end of the park. There are fountains in the midst of the lake, spraying mist that partly covers the area, making some like the view while others may rue the modern invasion  into an otherwise sedate country scenery. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_897" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-897" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003.jpg" alt="Benzaiten, Inokashira Park" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Benzaiten, Inokashira Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right in the middle of the park, at the area in front of the boating pier there are a few table and Chairs, a seating area, and rest rooms. There is also an entrance to the zoo here. Coffee and ice cream shops beckon a few steps away from here, across the main path heading out from the boating pier. The entire area around here has an English countryside feel. Especially the Rowing boats anchored at a side, the ice cream and coffee shops under the poplars and weeping willows may remind one of Peak District, Derby shire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further onward from the coffee shops walking still anticlockwise one approaches the end where the lake narrows into a small stream. There&#8217;s a little swan house, you can find the owners heading home if you happen to be here towards evening. A kiddy park with slides and swing is there at this end. The road curves back, with the embankment beside the lake being wider here. Artists performers and sundry entertainers set up their wares here.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_900" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-900" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005.jpg" alt="Away from it all right in the middle of the city" width="681" height="468" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005.jpg 681w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/INOKASHI00005-130x90.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Away from it all right in the middle of the city</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lake, the trees and the multicultural ambiance all added to the real estate value around the park. Single and two storied houses on the two sides of the approach road do look posh. And even the mansions on the other three sides surrounding the park having apartments balconies opening to the park also appear premium. No doubt it is a luxury to be living in such a place. But for us casual visitors also, there&#8217;s enough to do, take in and carry back home in the form of a well spent few hours. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrance to the park is free. Do follow the link to find more details on the park opening times, latest events and access information.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kodomo no kuni Tokyo Childrens Park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kodomo no Kuni in Japanese means Childrens Park. It&#8217;s really for Kodomos. And their parents who are keen to guard their children all the way to every ride! Yes it&#8217;s also for those still young at heart. For the child in you, you are allowed to go to the slide, ride the pony, take the small funny shaped cycle or ride a mechanical panda that merrily crawls about ding dong ding.</p>
<div id="attachment_870" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-870" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00010-300x206.jpg" alt="The view after entry" width="300" height="206" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00010-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00010-130x90.jpg 130w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00010.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The view after entry</p></div>
<div id="attachment_873" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-873" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00001-300x206.jpg" alt="On the way to water park" width="300" height="206" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00001-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00001-130x90.jpg 130w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00001.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">On the way to water park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge expanse of ex-military land, with hillocks, grassland, and lake separating themed play zones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right past the ticket gates, you enter into a wide open area. On the right a path goes through tall rows of pines/fir/spruce. On left there is a green hillock with children&#8217;s play area themed after zoo animals. Like an elephant slide, a giraffe zip line and so on and so forth. Around this area, there are a few old European style clubhouse buildings. Built after English Teutonic style. an indoor stadium is mostly used by local schools/clubs for teaching sports. A velvet layer of grass spans the area all around, from the children&#8217;s zone past the clubhouses towards the middle. Ideal for a game of basket ball or badminton. Families usually pitch tents at one end where the grass meets a posse of Sakura trees and tall spruces.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In between these two roads leading left and right, there is a football field size depression big enough to have two matches run side by side. Under military regime this could possibly have some scary use, but right now it is fashioned after children&#8217;s play area full of green grass separated by flower beds. &#8220;Nothing interesting&#8221; as per the eight year old boy in our team &#8211; &#8220;it&#8217;s just nice nothing to do&#8221;. But our ten year old girl found plenty of variety of poppies and butterflies. As the poet said beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Ofcourse we did not get much time to stand and behold. We were soon following the younger one onto the right hand side road that showed “rent a bicycle” signs. This road goes under a tunnel. Opens into the cycle themed play zone. The tunnel is good for testing how echo works! Lots of learnings for the curious mind!</p>
<div id="attachment_877" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-877" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00005-300x283.jpg" alt="Paddle powered flight" width="300" height="283" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00005-300x283.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00005.jpg 553w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paddle powered flight</p></div>
<div id="attachment_876" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-876" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00004-300x148.jpg" alt="Cycle Rink" width="300" height="148" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00004-300x148.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00004.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cycle Rink</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This cycle themed play area is unique in the sense there is a cycle rental, and there are a host of rides all moving on paddle power. There is an elevated railroad with helicopter shaped pods all driven by paddling. So two helicopters can start a race! How much more nice things could possibly be? Then there is a little roller coaster that is moved by the combined might of the riders. So you know this is a team event. Awesome. Next in the same complex there is a bike rink. Bikes with all sorts of funny mechanisms can be tried. Say some move with a zig zag movement . Some are having off center wheel shaft. So it moves with an elliptical movement of the wheel. Rider goes up down up down. Then there are those with a sitting area in front. It rotates slowly as the one paddles behind. Nice ride for a really little one in the front. Important is that one can finish a ride and change into another one. So there is a lot to experience! Within a time limit though. Caution &#8211; some among siblings may have better rides than the other. Fighting may ensue.</p>
<div id="attachment_875" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-875" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00003.jpg" alt="Mild Land ranch" width="681" height="468" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00003.jpg 681w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00003-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00003-130x90.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mild Land ranch</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rent a bike scheme is also different from many others. It&#8217;s not rented out for a half day or full day but for only one leg of the full cycle path around the park. So there is never a possibility of not getting a chance to experience it as the previous batch of riders come back and hand over. The path is quite long, takes at least fifteen minutes if continuously pushed. In between there are places though where one might like to stop and take photos. The cycle path goes at upper heights of the hillocks. Themed zones in between can be glanced from above. It&#8217;s a nice view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After returning your cycle you can start walk towards the next zone. Tall pines and cherry blossoms will give company. Next zone is the Milk zone. Animals can be petted in green ranch like area. There is a pony riding area. And there are fabulous fresh ice creams to have sitting on garden chairs.</p>
<div id="attachment_874" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-874" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00002-300x206.jpg" alt="Pony Riding" width="300" height="206" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00002-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00002-130x90.jpg 130w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00002.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pony Riding</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turn towards a tulip / seasonal flower bed. The road goes in between two hillocks on the two sides. And opens into water themed zone. A spring turns into a narrow shallow river with little stone slabs strewn around to help cross over. Suitable for all kids who have successfully graduated over from crawling state. And their parents. The “river” widens downstream with more water to play with. To the right of this area steps go up into a larger area with a lake in the center.</p>
<div id="attachment_868" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-868" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00008-300x206.jpg" alt="Towards water theme zone" width="300" height="206" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00008-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00008-130x90.jpg 130w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00008.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Towards water theme zone</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Boats of swan and other varieties float around. For the more traditional folks rowing boats are also available. Red elevated bridges connect to a central island. Good for taking a look around from the elevated top. There is also a punting zone, less popular though. And a swan lake, with a few swans idly floating or may be just busy applying the latest feather whitener. Very laid back.</p>
<div id="attachment_872" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-872" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00012-300x230.jpg" alt="Swan lake boating" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00012-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00012.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Swan lake boating</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moving ahead you reach the true water park area which comes into life in summer. But for those two months its closed. One may appreciate the trimmed hedges outside and move on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now again the green central depression with grass and flower beds come back into view.  But before your kids yell &#8220;that&#8217;s all?&#8221; &#8211; remember to head right into the gravity play zone. Well that&#8217;s a name I used in need, you can choose another. But what it has will interest the young ones. There is this conical well with four slides heading down to the center. One can slide down, then run back up following an elliptical path. Collisions may happen so care necessary. But at least in our case this one well kept our younger one busy for some time. For some time only though. So next we headed back up the stairs that let one to the highest curved roller-bed slide. It appears to fall from great height with dangerous curves but actually pretty safe with adequate speed breakers. In fact it is age appropriate for anyone aged 1 &#8211; 80. At least that&#8217;s the impression I got when a baby was crawling up the stairs past us and his grandma was hauling him down back into position in queue behind us, with Suimasens and Gomen nasais. Yes I was in queue, the baby was in queue, and so was his grandma mama papa brother sister. That&#8217;s the spirit of families isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<div id="attachment_881" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-881" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00011-231x300.jpg" alt="Tall winding slide for family" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00011-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00011-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KODOMO00011.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tall winding slide for family</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path off the slide headed back into the green grass land, past the club houses, towards the zoo themed rides. This one was truly for kids. Besides, yes I was tired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one last good thing was to get to hop back into the little two compartment train from the small station operated exclusively by Japan rail for Kodomo no Kuni! Oh yah if you are there like us during the cherry blossom season, you get plenty of blossoms covering the entire path from the station to the park and beyond. A treat on its own.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">Spring Cherry blossom festival at 1000 Sakura park Tokyo</h2>
<div id="attachment_835" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-835 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006.jpg" alt="Komatsugawa Sakura Matsuri" width="361" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006.jpg 361w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006-300x433.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Komatsugawa Sakura Matsuri</p></div>
<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">In Japanese tradition Cherry blossoms represent rejuvenation. After the bitter cold winter comes spring holding the hands of Cherry blossom. When it arrives it covers the neighborhood with gorgeous bloom. Somewhat akin to the old saying that tough times don&#8217;t last forever. And when the good times finally come it showers a fortune on the believer. For the Japanese Shinto who worshiped nature as God, Cherry blossoms thus are a direct revelation of the mystique. It&#8217;s the same kind of association as is Christmas in Christianity or Passover in Judaism. It&#8217;s time to forget the mundane, get out enjoy the beauty of nature with friends and family. In fact viewing the cherry blossoms while having a feast is a tradition with a name &#8211; Hanami. In pockets where there are Cherry blossom trees the entire neighborhood comes out and celebrates, sometimes with song and dance.</p>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">The SenBonZakura that is 1000 Sakura park in the Ojima Komatsugawa area at the eastern fringe of Tokyo is one such area. Originally a low lying marsh land, this area was reclaimed and developed with green parks and planned neighborhood by the side of river Arakawa. As a symbol of this regeneration cherry blossom trees were planted in droves along the Arakawa river banks. In due time the trees grew into famed 1000 sakuras that shroud the neighborhood in the 1st week of April. A grand neighborhood celebration follows. Temporary food stalls are set up. Visitors pitch tents in variety of shapes and colors. Song and dances by neighborhood artists grace a temporary stage. Horseback riding, traditional drumming performances (Taiko) and various such other attractions add to the ambiance.</p>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">Kids joyful shrieks playing with their friends, with their doting parents and grandparents fill in the surroundings. Scent of incense sticks lit in the alter of the family deity permeates through. Ladies in gorgeous traditional kimonos arrange Tea Ceremony, if nothing but for keeping the tradition alive and educating the current generation.</p>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">Over the years the celebration has grown and turned into a local matsuri  (festival) of its own. Like other years this year&#8217;s celebration for year 2016 was gorgeous as well. Presented in photos here are glimpses of the festivities. To listen to the sounds of Taiko drums, Horagais (traditional horns made from conch shells) and to see excerpts of the live performances, follow the below YouTube link.</p>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">As they say life is ethereal and so are the cherry blossoms. The Japanese hold this association close to heart and tries to live every moment of the one or two weeks that the blossoms last. This article is just an effort to extend that feeling across to a wider audience, and make it last a little longer. Hope you enjoyed it.

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ueno Park Tokyo &#8211; hanami and the lily pond</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than a hundred and fifty years ago, a fierce battle was fought on the hill of Ueno. The battle ended the reign of Samurai shoguns and restored the power of Meiji emperor. A new chapter started in Japan&#8217;s history.</p>
<div id="attachment_757" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008-231x300.jpg" alt="History as a company" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">History as a company</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the beginning of the current Ueno park. A huge temple complex that stood around here was mostly destroyed in the battle. In its place came up a vast open park area, with a part housing a cache of arts, science and history museums and another part housing the first zoo in Tokyo.</p>
<div id="attachment_741" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-741" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010.jpg" alt="through the cherry blossoms" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">through the cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today Ueno park plays host to numerous festivals and is home to visitors from across Japan and abroad. With the Keisei line connection to Narita airport originating from here, it has naturally become a tourist activity center. Annual social festivals like Hanami the cherry blossom viewing-eating-drinking has been of the biggest festivals held in its premises. During the 7-10 days of cherry blossom season in April the park becomes colored with that of cherry blossoms, and of the lanterns hung in the evening, interspersed with the colors of the kimonos of joyous guests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The park is right next to Akihabara the electronics district of Tokyo. The area however still bears some characteristics of the historic era that it belonged to. Lately being a junction station for Tourists arriving from Narita international airport, it has been swept with touristy flavors to some extent. All mixed together, Ueno park has evolved into an eclectic mix.</p>
<div id="attachment_763" style="width: 258px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-763" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park-248x300.jpg" alt="Map of Ueno Park" width="248" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park-248x300.jpg 248w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park-300x364.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park.jpg 373w" sizes="(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Map of Ueno Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main Approaching road is from Ameyokocho, the last standing bazaar district  of modern Tokyo. Get down from subway Ginza line / Hibiya Line Ueno station, or JR Yamanote line Ueno station. Cross the road over. And a moist breeze coming from the forested hills greets visitors. Granite stairs go up. Notice boards around declare the historic importance of this park. The road divides here, takes to two ways. One goes up, past the Kiyomizu Kannon temple and the Toshogu shrines in Crimson red. The other goes around the hill, and takes a turn towards the lake at the base of the hill.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hanami</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The road up by the wooden shrine complex winds its way through dense woods. In summer the canopy shades the weary. In spring the blossoms of Sakura hosts the Hanami crowd. For the few weeks of end March till early April this whole area turns into a party venue. Groups of people from all walks of the big city descend here, securing their own spot under the cherry trees. The sacred tradition of celebrating spring with family and friends  has over the years become an event on the calendar of the city bred. Business colleagues, ex-colleagues meet up and celebrate together hoping for a prosperous year ahead. As evening descends, lanterns hung from the trees light up the whole area in a yellow incandescence. Time passes on amidst cheers and laughter.</p>
<div id="attachment_760" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-760" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012.jpg" alt="Hanami in the evening" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanami in the evening</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path winds its way past statues of past leaders and opens into a wide boulevard. This area has a lot to offer to a variety of audience. Around the central row of fountains and several restaurants, Edifices of national importance such as the national science museum , national museum of art, international modern art museum and national library have been set up. Close to the national museum, a wooded zone harbors children&#8217;s play area and few restaurants. The buildings  in the boulevard border its three sides from right to left. The path ends at Ueno zoo at extreme left. Ueno zoo is the first and one of the best known zoos around. We shall talk more about the zoo and the museums in other articles. Let&#8217;s take our walk back to where we started the path up the hill.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The way around the hill goes towards the Ueno lake. It is divided into separate water bodies by criss crossing pedestrian walk ways. At the extreme end it merges into the lower tier of Ueno zoo. Visitors to the zoo get the best view of this part. Several enclosures of zoo inhabitants like the red beak flamingoes border the meandering lake. Restaurants set up benches by the waters. In Summer the lake gets filled up with giant water lilies. Varieties of migratory birds flock in, making this lily covered pond their home for the season.</p>
<div id="attachment_753" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-753" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007-231x300.jpg" alt="View from deck of Bentendo " width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View from deck of Bentendo</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next section of the lake, further away from zoo, weaves around a Buddhist temple the Bentendo at its center. Visited by both locals and tourists, it becomes crowded quickly during the afternoons on weekends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Essence from the burning incense sticks fills in the area. Food stalls selling chocolate covered stuff to fried squids line up the approach way to the shrine. A weeping cherry blossoms tree standing at a corner of the temple complex bends down with the weight of the flowers touching the water below. Ducks come swimming looking for food in the undergrowth. It&#8217;s a photographer&#8217;s delight.</p>
<div id="attachment_756" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-756" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00005.jpg" alt="Bentendo shrine" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00005.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bentendo shrine</p></div>
<div id="attachment_752" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-752" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00006-300x230.jpg" alt="The weeping blossoms" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00006-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00006.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The weeping blossoms</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Lily Pond</h2>
<div id="attachment_748" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-748" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002-208x300.jpg" alt="Shinobazu - the lily pond" width="208" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002-300x433.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Shinobazu &#8211; the lily pond</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path crossing onto the other side past the temple is hemmed on the two sides by water bodies. One side has wooden walkways, to let visitors venture into the depths, to see the colored fish swimming around. And to appreciate the lotus blossoms in summer as the flowers stir their heads up from under the giant leaves. This is a popular meeting area for city folks, known as Shinobazu pond.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cherry blossoms by the lakeside</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other side of the walkway is let for boating. Colored fiberglass boats in various shapes float around. Benches on the sides let people take in the view as long as they please. But the area fills in early with Hanami crowd during the cherry blossom season. Cherry blossom trees bordering the lake fill up the waters with a pink layer of petals. Couples in their traditional best take a break on the benches. Photographers get busy trying to take that one memorable shot. Sometimes a lonely musician finds his tune by the water under the cherry blossoms. The high chords of sax or the merry tunes of accordion sets an ambiance of its own.</p>
<div id="attachment_755" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-755" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003.jpg" alt="Boating lake turned pink by the cherry blossoms" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Boating lake turned pink by the cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path heads back towards the busy Ameyokocho crossing. A cultural complex with artificial fountain on one side of its boundary wall tries to present another reason to stop once more. And appreciate the area around. The vast expanse of the lake, the cherry blossoms in spring, the lotus in summer, the vermilion red wooden Buddhist temple in the middle, the hill going up. The history, the culture, it&#8217;s memories. Foreign tunes sometimes float in, coming from the occasional hula dance sessions held at the cultural center. On other times, it&#8217;s mostly a quiet area, a break from the busy business district across the road at Ameyokocho and a little farther down where there is Akihabara, the neon lit electronics district.</p>
<div id="attachment_761" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-761" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00013.jpg" alt="Hanami get togethers" width="281" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00013.jpg 281w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00013-162x300.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanami get togethers</p></div>
<div id="attachment_750" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-750" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00004.jpg" alt="Ducks swimming under the blossoms" width="361" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00004.jpg 361w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00004-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00004-300x433.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ducks swimming under the blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ueno park holds a special place in the fabric of this city. The history borne by the vestiges of Buddhist shrines, the gentrified cultural complexes, the lily filled water bodies, all come together to forge this identity. Take your time. Explore this area. You will perhaps come back more times than you originally planned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Boot camp Tarzan</h2>
<p>In our childhood Tarzan was the king of the jungles, swinging in at the right time to rescue a poor someone in trouble and then swinging back from one tree to the other back deep into the jungles. But to be like Tarzan one had to be in the African jungle, lost as a child, to be precise. The options were thus limited. But in today&#8217;s world kids have more options. So if some wannabe Tarzan is there in your house, why not he can hone his skills in Heiwa no mori koen&#8230;.?</p>
<p>At a 30 minute journey away from Shinjuku, this sizable park is different from its peers in its sheer focus on rope and log based fitness tricks. Perhaps seen more usually in Ninja classics, these contraptions in the form of a rope ladder going up and down and/or around a set of stilts call for considerable physical agility and fitness. And there lies the charm of this place for the young ones.</p>
<p>The actual park is segregated into two sections, one with a water park for kids, a few slides and carousel type standard park sets. There is also a wide grass field for playing soccer etc. The other is the ninja area, separated by a road from its more benign sister.</p>
<p>A low entry ticket entitles you to a map cum logbook to mark which all rides that are completed. Arranged in a marked sequence of rides there are 40, yes f-o-r-t-y individual pieces of challenge. It starts with a relatively simple walk, balancing on a few logs held at an elevated height. It is then followed by one where you jump up and hang onto a series of rings trying to cross over. Next, you ride up the side of a well and jump onto the center rope wriggling down to the floor.</p>
<div id="attachment_395" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-395" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00001-300x300.jpg" alt="Heiwa no mori koen - beginning" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00001.jpg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Heiwa no mori koen &#8211; beginning</p></div>
<h2>Ninjas beware</h2>
<p>Now the rides more and more approach into Ninja territory. After the previous few warm ups, the ninja is next challenged to try out his balance skills. The rides here switch to a set of logs floating on watery channel. Participants have to jump from one log to another to cross the channel while making sure not to fall into the water.</p>
<div id="attachment_394" style="width: 223px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-394" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00002-213x300.jpg" alt="Ninja water balance" width="213" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00002-213x300.jpg 213w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00002.jpg 222w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ninja water balance</p></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s not left just at that. To complete the fun, at some points one has to jump into a rope and swing ones way across the channel. At another point row across standing on a flat wooden plank pushing an oar.</p>
<p>The route takes one up a climbing wall, into a tree house type platform, and through a curved pipe onto a swinging rope bridge. A few rides take the rope walking to its extreme, carving out challenges that make the little ninjas ever more determined to do it.</p>
<div id="attachment_396" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00003.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-396" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00003-300x300.jpg" alt="Scale up higher" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00003-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/HEIWA00003.jpg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scale up higher</p></div>
<p>At each point there is a pencil with which the successful rider marks on his map his conquest. The entire 40 rides can comfortably cover a good two hours, or three. At the end there is a bathing and changing room to allow the participants change into a cleaner pair of dresses as one is highly likely to have a muddy wet pair on. If this is not fun then what else, eh?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Makuhari Messe, Chiba</h2>
<p>Once this was a low lying delta area. As Tokyo expanded, land reclamation process for real estate development started. Residential Urayasu, leisure park Kasai Rinkai koen and Disneyland came up by the sea shore between Tokyo and Chiba. Along this line the latest development to come up is Makuhari, a vast new planned area with convention centers, shopping malls and man made beaches. Costco the American shopping chain has a branch here. Aeon shopping mall occupies several blocks. The beach has hosted the international dare devil Red Bull air race recently. But behind all this, the region is known for Makuhari Messe, the vast modern permanent international exhibition and convention center. Messe has been home to popular events like Tokyo Motor show and Tokyo Robot show.</p>
<h2>CEATEC</h2>
<p>Japan has been a leader in development of robots. Toyota is well known for the efficient use of man and robots in its assembly line. Robots are also being used as companion to the elderly. Pepper the humanoid robot interacts with shoppers in SoftBank stores. Even there is this Robot restaurant in Shinjuku popular with tourists. So in this country the Robot show will naturally be a huge draw.</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_NDA-_ph5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So SEATEC mega robot show in Makuhari is not surprisingly quite popular. The robot show at CEATEC this year unveiled several demos of robots using advanced artificial intelligence to participate in human activities.</p>
<div id="attachment_378" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ROBU00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-378" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ROBU00002-300x236.jpg" alt="Robot playing pingpong" width="300" height="236" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ROBU00002-300x236.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ROBU00002.jpg 315w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Robot playing pingpong</p></div>
<p>A very popular spot was one where a Robot was playing table tennis with a Human counterpart.</p>
<p>Fitted with a camera and a mechanical hand holding the bat, the robot was calculating the movement of the ball, the best angle to strike back and the force with which to strike it back onto opponent on the other side of the net. All this in real time!!!</p>
<p>This kind of advanced human interaction was also evident in another popular demo wherein a robot receptionist  made to look like a real human being was introducing a product. This was as close as one could get to a creation like that of professor Hiroshi Ishiguro, world wide known for his humanoid robots.  The facial skin, eye and lip</p>
<div id="attachment_379" style="width: 151px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ROBU00001.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-379" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ROBU00001.jpg" alt="Robot Receptionist " width="141" height="245" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Robot Receptionist</p></div>
<p>movements, everything looked very much human like.</p>
<p>Another demo for a Google-glass like product, though much limited in functionality, proved popular. For trying out this glass people happily stood in queue for upwards of 40 minutes. Some well-known under evaluation development products were also there such as Honda Uni Cub. One element missing was probably the Google self driving cars, though one is not sure whether it should feature in annual Auto show or in this Robots show. Let&#8217;s wait and see&#8230;</p>
