				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2> Galaxcity Is Galaxy Full of Fun For Kids Day Out In Tokyo</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Touch wood Tokyo weather is generally pleasant. But there are days when it&#8217;s cold and rainy. Now what do you do if it&#8217;s cold and rainy, and you have kids who so looked forward to a days outing on weekend. It&#8217;s tough. </span>For such hard times GalaxCity comes to your rescue. It&#8217;s indoor but Indoor does not mean video games. No, nope. It&#8217;s full of activities, like scaling up a rock climbing wall, learning about planets and space, making creative use of paper and stuff. in short, as the name says, its a galaxy of fun for kids day out in Tokyo. And it&#8217;s all provided courtesy city municipality. Read on if you are interested.</p>
<div id="attachment_1287" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1287" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-300x300.jpg" alt="Learning about space and asteroids" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Learning about space and asteroids</p></div>
<h3>The Planetarium</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rin and Paku, the two kids separated from their family. They were born in tough times. Like just when young Rin flopped out of her egg shell, she was attacked by a hungry Tyrannosaur! Thankfully mom reached just in time!. But mommy had to mind a cackle of kids. So Rin soon again found herself lost. winter setting in there was little that Rin could do. After all the place was Alaska, known to have particularly severe winter. Luckily she found Paku, a member from her brood. Together they braved some really tough winter. And a deadly encounter with another monstrous Tyrannosaur. Rin was picked up hanging by the jaws. Just in time Paku the braveheart came running and lunged at the tyrant. The blow threw the mean beast into cold icy water. Then spring came. Good times followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the story projected on a huge planetarium wall. Mixed with oodles of knowledge bits on evolution of earth and the solar system, how seasons change with earth&#8217;s orbit, and about evolution of life. Which kid do you think would not love it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the kids parents, the low low prices were an added surprise. A full planetarium in the middle of the busy Adachi city. screening various shows on space, rockets, animals, adventure etc etc. for a coin! Yeah one felt Happy to have paid taxes, for once.</span><br />
<iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3236.8211685491606!2d139.78831031526158!3d35.77976898017142!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x601891e8f43d821b%3A0x6ff2af520de04088!2z44Ku44Oj44Op44Kv44K344OG44Kj!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1491316042959" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>Net Athletics Zone</h3>
<div id="attachment_1284" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1284 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002.jpg" alt="The Galaxcity Net Athletics Zone" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Galaxcity Net Athletics Zone &#8211; full of fun day for kids in Adachi Tokyo</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this planetarium was just an added bonus, Icing on the cake. If your kids love to play, jump, run, then you should first hit the central hall. It&#8217;s a three storied high world made of nets. Nets make the first floor, the second, the third. Connected through chutes, made of nets. Kids can jump a la trampoline style. Go up an incline and slide down. Or simply lie down like on a hammock and enjoy the vibrations courtesy others.</span></p>
<h3>The Climbing Wall</h3>
<div id="attachment_1289" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1289" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007.jpg" alt="The Climbing Wall" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Climbing Wall</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is not enough, then go for the climbing wall. Three story high, with safety harness, helmets, belaying cable. instructors using laser pointers to guide the young mountaineers to the next best hold.</span></p>
<h3>Digital Play</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, if your kid is still too young for climbing, how about some learning through digital play? There&#8217;s a room with two screens for engaging the younger ones. On the first, letters fall from a tree, like leaves in fall. The kids have to catch the letters that make up particular word. The word is shown in the beginning. Hang on, it&#8217;s not just that. The word is not written as it is but a picture is shown. The kid has to get the word and then catch the falling letters in sequence. As is expected the letters fall all over the place, just like fall leaves on a breezy day. So kids need to move/jump/run a bit to catch.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1286" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1286 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004.jpg" alt="Digital Play" width="741" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Digital Play</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next screen projects a collection of colored shapes. The more active the kid standing in front, the more colors come up. </span></p>
<h3>For The Creative Ones</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next out there, there are a couple of painting and craft making rooms. The creative ones will love the bright spacious rooms, with several tables in each. Parents and children are free to pick up the art objects or craft items. Instructors are there, too.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1285" style="width: 164px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1285 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-154x300.jpg" alt="Art and Craft classes" width="154" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-300x583.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003.jpg 381w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Art and Craft classes</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is still one more &#8211; a baby&#8217;s play pen. Secure, colorful, soft matted, with plenty of space to crawl about.</span></p>
<h3>Essential Bits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Do you agree all the above makes for a cool day out? If still wondering about stuff such as food, then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">worry not, that also is taken care of nicely. An attached restaurant right outside serves yummy dishes like curry rice, chicken rice, pasta, sandwiches in a well lit colorful setting. Of course vending machines are there at every floor, as you would surely expected.</span></p>
<p>One caveat &#8211; you need to reach early and buy tickets early otherwise space fills up soon. Secondly, socks is a must everywhere. And thirdly no skirts/frocks only trousers. Oh yes its not so touristy so Nihongo dake de onegai shimas (guides speak only Japanese) &#8230;</p>
<p>For booking and latest shows refer to the website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.galaxcity.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.galaxcity.jp/</a></p>
<h3>More Choices</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one thing about this Galaxcity is that it&#8217;s slightly off the main Tokyo city amusement / shopping areas. If you wanted to combine shopping then check <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/kids-day-out-in-tokyo-science-playareum/" target="_blank">Sony ExploraScience</a> or <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/panasonic-risupia-science-for-kids/" target="_blank">Panasonic Risupia</a> in Odaiba. Or full play and only play, then head to Children&#8217;s world in Shibuya. On the other hand if a day full of learning is the demand, then check out <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/science-museum-tokyo-dayout-for-kids/" target="_blank">Science Museum</a>. Did somebody just say what to do it&#8217;s raining on a weekend …?</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sony Explora Science &#8211; its a kids day out in Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Odaiba the Tokyo shopping and entertainment island, Sony Explorascience is tucked at a corner in glistening shopping mall. An unlikely placement but then that is perhaps it&#8217;s charm. Does not make learning a tedium rather makes it more of a joy. Thus it perfectly blends in with its surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.sonyexplorascience.jp/english/" target="_blank">http://www.sonyexplorascience.jp/english/</a></p>
<div id="attachment_705" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-705" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002-231x300.jpg" alt="All smile competition" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">All smile competition</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you get inside past the ticket gate, it&#8217;s all full of touchy feely activities that prod even the crankiest one to smile. Yes smile one must as the first game itself calls for participants standing in front of a giant screen to smile. The best smile is judged by a camera and it puts a crown onto the winner! A bunch of people all smiling their best is certainly a good beginning.</p>
<div id="attachment_708" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-708" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00005-300x230.jpg" alt="One to one smile contest" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00005-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00005.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One to one smile contest</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The theme is then carried forward to the next game, where ones smile is judged comparing with day&#8217;s other contestants and a rank is assigned. As per the rank one gets to be a member of a favorite football team say of Brazil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This kind of smile contest sees some serious competition in a later game where two contestants from amongst the visitors sit next to each other facing the screen in front, and smile their teeth out.</p>
<div id="attachment_711" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-711" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00003-1-300x230.jpg" alt="Smile Winners Team" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00003-1-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00003-1.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Smile Winners Team</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The winning smiler knocks the other one out, proceeding to next stage. It&#8217;s so addictive I have seen people coming back to queue for one more attempt!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other games also are all such participative/ addictive, all using principle of light and sound as basic learning tools. There is this game of ping pong where one can strike colorful little disks which are actually projected light. Sensors sense the player’s movement and calculate where the disk would be.</p>
<div id="attachment_709" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-709" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00004-300x230.jpg" alt="Mobile signals jumping from tower to tower" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00004-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00004.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mobile signals jumping from tower to tower</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such virtual projection based game is there in a more active way in dancing studio. Dancers dance and their movement is transferred into a screen character that dances in tune. Then there are displays where the person in front is scanned by a camera and the software places him / her in the story board being displayed on monitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In next another game a design is projected on a white board and two contestants vigorously wave their hands as if to color the design from their part of the board. Sensors sense the movement of the contestants and reflect that on the projected image as if it is being colored off. Of course one wins and that is the fun.</p>
<div id="attachment_707" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-707" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00006-300x178.jpg" alt="Color me fast" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00006-300x178.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00006.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Color me fast</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like the way light is processed through sensors, sound is also processed in some games and the output is projected either visually or through touch. So for example there is a sound blob contest to make different pitch of sound. A visual ball goes up / inflates / fattens as per the contestants will and the sound made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there are 3D display walls, the 3D movie hall and the experience center where participants carrying small LCD touch pads move in a room the walls of which have A deep sea projected around. As if the viewer has dived down into the depths of ocean. The characters floating by can interact with the person carrying the LCD panel. At different parts of the wall creatures belonging to different oceans in the world swim past.</p>
<div id="attachment_706" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-706" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00001-300x230.jpg" alt="And the winner is..." width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00001-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00001.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">And the winner is&#8230;</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall it is a mish mash of games and learning where the learners fight to learn!  Its a complete kids day out, for hands on learning through play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Science Playareum, as a team couchflyer member said, a word invented in the spirit of experiment&#8230;!!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Its Science Playareum</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See the below video for complete experience of Sony Explorascience a science playareum</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tepia &#8211; Fun Science Day Out for Kids in Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unavoidable fact of life &#8211; kids will ask questions. An awful lot of them, if you have a kid like ours. Solution lies not in answering or explaining, because that will inevitably lead to more questions. It is when you give them something to do through which they can find the answer themselves, their curiosity is satiated. Great men no doubt realized it long back. Result is that most big cities have got one or more science museums, observatories, ocean aquariums etc. Tokyo, being the largest city, has many. We with our pre-teens happened to find ourselves at the ticket counters of most. Yesterday it was no different, another weekend another visit to a science exhibition, only though there was no ticket gate there. Free, newly set up and partly sponsored by industrial houses, TEPIA in Omotesando area is a showcase for companies working in electronics and robotics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.tepia.jp/english" target="_blank">https://www.tepia.jp/english</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The TEPIA logo is visible right as one steps out of gate number 3 of Gaienmae station, Ginza subway line. Out of the gate, turn right, walk by the side of Meiji Jingu stadium for a few minutes, the entrance is at the right hand side. The exhibit right at the entrance lobby is a huge super-high resolution TV screen by Toshiba. Turn right, you will be facing a magic mirror. The fun starts from here.</p>
<div id="attachment_691" style="width: 397px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-691" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001.jpg" alt="Social robot Wakamaru" width="387" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001.jpg 387w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001-223x300.jpg 223w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001-300x404.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Social robot Wakamaru</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meet Wakamaru, the bright yellow colored highly social extra terrestrial. Loves to talk, loves to take photo with you, and asks you meet him again when you come next. The cute robots continue to meet you as you step into the 2nd floor lab. But right here at 1st floor, there&#8217;s enough to keep your young ones engaged. There is a display of little robots, a couple of inches in height, walking around a small circular path, never colliding, and navigating past obstacles placed on the way. Here it is not just about what a robot can do. You must have already been to Miraikan and seen ASIMO. Or been greeted by Pepper at Softbank stores. If not read the relevant articles in this site. But here, the stress is on the social aspect of robotics. How they interact with one another and with us humans. Kind of a preview of Google car era. To help little ones feel at home with these robot  peers coming soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_NDA-_ph5I" target="_blank">Pepper Robot in Softbank mobile store</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moving on, there is an Augmented reality display that offers incredible immersive experience. Engaging enough to get full family sit down on the sofa and start playing! As one waves the little video game controller pointing at the big screen in front, a pack of giggling little extra terrestrials land onto the carpet in front. These little ones wave their hands, jump and roll, kind of filling the whole carpet. Wave your hand, the little guys topple, jump aside, then gets up and makes faces at you! All funny, cutesy, super engaging. You step off the sofa, those guys move about. If those little naughty ones make you tired, just rub the controller pointing at them. A vacuum seemingly sucks them back in. Interaction can scarcely be any better than this! You need to keep some time in your hand for this exhibit as it tends to get crowded pretty soon.</p>
<div id="attachment_695" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-695" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005.jpg" alt="Augmented reality experience" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Augmented reality experience</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next there is this small room with an interactive wall. On the wall there is a scenery from  a Manga cartoon book. City high rises, or old village. As you stand in front, you enter the scenery. Next a series of instructions tell you a story and you choose to interact with the building, the road, the belongings. Depending on your interaction the plot moves. In a 10 minute interaction a manga cartoon story gets created with you being the central character. Cool, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<div id="attachment_690" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-690 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008-208x300.jpg" alt="Manga cartoon with starring yourself" width="208" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008-300x433.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Manga cartoon with starring yourself</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are quite a few displays like this, making you part of an interactive happening. Kids love them all. Then there was this workshop on building an electronic circuit. A new entrant after Makey makey, AGIC  is the maker of silver ink pens that can be used to directly draw a circuit on paper. Kids were asked to draw a square using a pen given. The square had to have a gap at the top line to house a LED lamp and another gap to house a small battery with two wires. When all connected and securely placed with cello tapes, the bulb starts glowing. So does the faces of the kids! It&#8217;s their own created circuit, they get to keep it, after suitably decorating the inside space  of the circuit with their imagination. Box of color pens are kept there for that. Learning can be fun, a lot of fun if you are in TEPIA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://agic.cc/en" target="_blank">URL for AGIC</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it need not be only electronics. There are some displays that explain human body, some explains natural disasters such as earthquakes and how engineers are coming up with new and new ideas to protect buildings from earthquakes. Surprisingly these are also interactive. For example the exhibit that explains how a layer of air separates an apartment building from its foundation that keeps shaking due to earthquake. Using a law of physics, it shows how easy it is to levitate up a huge heavy installation. How easy? One of us stood on a platform made of two glass plates with a thin layer of liquid in between. As soon as one blew through a pipe leading to the layer in between, the upper layer of the platform lifted up. We so far blew only to blow a bubble or a balloon. Lifting a person up &#8211; never thought of it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2nd floor there is a dedicated robotics teaching center. Classes are organized regularly.  At off times, one can see and play with creations kept as exhibits. Such as two small one wheeled robots moving about in an arena at the center of the room. Two robots which can be controlled to kick a football and score goals. A snail shaped robot that traces its path slowly around a magnetic strip. Then there are computer terminals one can access to look up a video library full of instructables.</p>
<div id="attachment_693" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-693" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003-300x300.jpg" alt="Robot snail - miles to go" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Robot snail &#8211; miles to go</p></div>
<div id="attachment_692" style="width: 214px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-692" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002-204x300.jpg" alt="Messibot vs Ronaldobot" width="204" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002-204x300.jpg 204w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002-300x440.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002.jpg 355w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Messibot vs Ronaldobot</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a small theater and a restaurant onSecond floor. Helpful for both kids and their parents, after a two hour round of the complex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, it&#8217;s a nice half day outing. Not as big or busy or famous as Miraikan or Sony Explora Science, but good enough to get your kids a welcome dose of science. Only regret from the younger one was that, there was not enough to do such as ride or scale up and hang down from. And from me as dad dragged out of bed on a holiday morning &#8211; the bed being shown on the huge TV alas it looked too alluring to be so not true….</p>

<h2>Science for kids by Panasonic</h2>
<p>For most of ordinary folks like me the Panasonic brand stands for latest in audio visual products. Granted Panasonic is not just that, in fact it is leading research in areas of assisted mobility, amongst many others. It is to sensitize people like me about its wide area of activities there is this spacious well appointed Panasonic building in Odaiba.</p>
<p>Smack in the middle of shopping malls and entertainment complex, it indeed tries hard to drive home the brand message while not being neither too mall like nor too serious. The all glass and steel structure  with pristine white interiors convey a kind of space age ambiance. A central atrium with race track for kids, having real time track visuals projected on a large LED wall, does indeed convey a sporty brand image.</p>
<p>On one side of the hall there is a little tabletop city. Comprising of garden and villas  with a set of moving trains, with a cache of latest cameras kept next, is meant to appeal to latest camera tech enthusiasts.</p>
<p>A path inside from the hall, with potted plants on two sides giving  it an ambiance of a garden path, leads to a special display room. Special with vertical greenery on all the walls. It is perhaps to represent Panasonic&#8217;s interest in low energy green science.</p>
<p>In short the purpose of existence of this building  is well justified by the careful display of modernity that subtly introduces its core business.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">But nowhere does it resort  to bare advertising. In itself this concept of  gentle understatement is a welcome one amongst a world full of glaring neon signs crying me too.</span></p>
<h2>Touchy Feely Laws of Motion</h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">On top of it the 2nd and 3rd floors house Panasonic Risupia, the science hall for the young and/or curious. This element adds an additional creativity to the already well orchestrated presentation. The 2nd floor lobby right out of the elevator has a series of workstations. Children can sit and scroll through the large touch screen icons to learn about various science and nature topics. The layout of the individual  desks and workspace, the overall colour combination of the sitting area oozes a creative ambience. Even the really small ones can relish in a set of imaginatively created displays set up opposite the workstations. Simple experiment on gravity, when combined with principle of shifting center of gravity, gives rise to a set of hollow wooden pucks sort of dancing down a path. Kids never tire of picking up the pucks and placing back on the top just to see those amble down in a hilarious motion. Then there are the little marbles that make a cling clang sound when rolled down a carved passage and rolling over metal plates.</span></p>
<p>But the experiments graduate to more awesome ones as you turn left from the elevator. Here more of science is at play in the different exhibits displaying the effects of gravity on different sized paths, or generation of electricity when a piece of magnet is moved through a copper coil.  There&#8217;s exhibits on how levers work, how conservation of momentum is visible in a set of similarly sized pendulums when swung in a set of 1, 2,3 or more. Each one is touchy feely, each experience is carefully chosen to surprise and impress. Science could not have been presented any more creatively, one might wonder.</p>
<h2>Light, Sound and Action</h2>
<div id="attachment_368" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-368" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia-300x200.jpg" alt="Panasonic Risupia" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Panasonic Risupia</p></div>
<p>But then there is the upper floor which focuses on light and sound. The 500 yen entry ticket in this floor secures a hand held unit for you.  This is to display a track of your exploits  in the games and exhibits, plus to let you get more info on each exhibit.  Once done  the device automatically upload your entire experience history for you to download later at home. As you step in, you go past a set of concave convex mirrors that change you into slim or err healthy. This and other themes build up the story finally that rolled into a 3D panorama at the last display.</p>
<p>OK, lets take a step at a time. The next exhibit past the mirrors introduces you to concave convex lenses, using which you have to focus a picture. Then a next one lets you play with sound. With a wave of your hand you control the pitch of sound. It is visible in the shape of the wave reflected on the wall. And a further one let&#8217;s you solve a puzzle projected visually on a wall in front. Real pieces of various shaped articles need to be arranged matching the projected shape. The activity by participant is monitored and helpful hints are projected onto the wall.</p>
<p>A further more complex but an immensely popular display involves more interaction in the way of trying to arrange a set of shapes on a magnetic wall. The shapes so arranged are to guide a set of balls, projected on the wall, popping out of a tube at the top and rolling down into another open tube below. The way the shapes are placed guides realistically how the balls run down below as if the projected ball shaped lights are really 3D objects. The whole activity changes very fast, moves through levels and challenges participants based on how well they could arrange the shapes and catch the balls.</p>
<p>All such interaction finally leads to the 3D show that raises the bar on immersive experience. While we are still waiting for personal VR or AR devices, this one gives us a glimpse of how it feels to be in the midst of a projected story and interact with the objects in the story. Attendees  chosen through a quick game of &#8220;stone paper scissors&#8221; are invited onto a small stage right among the audience. As he or she steps onto the stage, the projection equipment let them step into the story. The audience gets to interact with the boys and girls in the story as the story progresses. The stories change according to the show times but the experience really changes ones perception about where science can be heading to.</p>
<p>And that is after all the intention of Panasonic Risupia, to engage and interact with its audience the common man. A half a day outing can be an enjoyable one on any day especially if it&#8217;s too hot outside or say rainy. For us the Couchflyer team it is a good outing on any day!</p>
