<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mitsubishi industrial museum Yokohama</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mitsubishi is commonly known as the GE of Japan. Been in business for more than a century. From grain trading to aircraft and ship manufacturing it has its imprints everywhere. It owns large tracts of land and real estate in Otemachi, the downtown business center of Tokyo. So it has much to show and tell to the coming generations. The 2 floor museum in Yokohama seaside is a tribute to this rich history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designed in futuristic shades of white and grey it is part of a sky-high Mitsubishi building on the museum street. Reachable easily by JR from Sakuragicho station or from metro Minaromirai line Minaromirai station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We went for a visit on Saturday this last week of August. On the way we decided to take a short detour &#8211; take a trip on steamer from Yokohama station. Got down at MinatoMirai pier. Walked two blocks to reach the museum. Tickets purchased straight in we headed towards the man in space suit. It&#8217;s actually just the space suit, with stairs behind for little ones to climb up into the space suit! An ideal photo op. The exhibits here on wards proved to be equally interesting.</p>
<div id="attachment_1064" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1064" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008-300x300.jpg" alt="The Space Suit and the central hall" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Space Suit and the central hall</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First on the right of the space suit there is a driving simulator. Suppose you want to feel how it feels to be a driver driving a subway train. A giant LCD screen displays stations passing by as you / your little co-passenger drives. Others can take a sit in behind the driver. There was a long queue though.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Ocean Exploration Hall</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next on we headed towards the ocean exploration room. It houses a giant submersible, a mock up of SHINKAI 6500 the deep sea submersible. visitors can take a peek inside the control chamber. There is even a simulation game for the little explorer to control a submersible through a deep sea passage! A piece of thick metal plated vessel kept at one comer seems to have been sheared off by some undersea monster. It actually shows how thick the walls of a submersible need to be. Else water pressure tears a vessel apart made of solid steel! There were puzzle games to be played on screen &#8211; stuff like build a submersible by dragging and dropping pieces. Neat, for our eight year old.</p>
<div id="attachment_1062" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1062 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006.jpg" alt="The ocean exploration hall" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The ocean exploration hall</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Space Exploration Hall</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next halt was the room on aircrafts. The nose cone of a Real aircraft peeked out of the room. It was a mockup of a real passenger jet! Cut into half, with the pilots cabin and a few sits behind being set up there. Young pilots can experience flying using real controls through simulator. His/her passengers can watch from behind. Seat bests must. Enough to experience a flight, on land. Beware the queue here can get really long especially on weekends.</p>
<div id="attachment_1061" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1061" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005.jpg" alt="The aircraft experience area" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The aircraft experience area</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The passage next winds through an alleyway with walls on two sides depicting space history in pictures. The passage opens into an area for rockets, showcasing exhaust pipes of rockets. Big enough to qualify as a room of a capsule hotel!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The passage then heads into an innocuous corner marked with pictures of balloons, aero planes, satellites and rockets. As one stands in the center of the corner, an overhead camera is activated. It projects images down showing pictures of Yokohama, Japan, the green and blue earth, the Arctic lights,shooting stars passing by. It gives a feeling as if one is going up, with projections showing views as seen from a balloon, a helicopter, an aeroplane, a satellite, all in their average altitudes. A strand of light blinks its way up showing the height reached at each point. A very engaging way of demonstrating how high up really is the space.</p>
<div id="attachment_1060" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1060" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004.jpg" alt="The Space History exploration area" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Space History exploration area</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stepping out of the corner we take a few steps and reach the 3D projection room. A small room of circular shape, big enough to perhaps hold 10 persons standing comfortably. not that impressive in the beginning. But as the demonstration started, things changed. Cameras projected images on the wall and the floor. Lights changed, turning the floor pitch black with a few stars here and there. From floor to the wall it was a continuous 3-dimensional screen, with we spectators standing somewhere in this expanse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon we were standing at the edge of the earth. An alien space craft appeared in the horizon. It came closer. The spacecraft came closer and closer, doors opened, stairs extended, slowly reached our level. In no time we were at the bridge. I was ready in my mind, Light Sabres activated. Did I just hear foot steps, sound of heavy breathe? The show ended. In a word it was captivating &#8211; especially if you do not know what to expect off it.Â  Sorry, am such a spoiler.</p>
<div id="attachment_1065" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003.jpg" alt="Intergalatic journey" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Intergalatic journey</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2nd Floor Energy Information Gallery</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next upstairs the gallery opened into wide open space without any separation wall. Zones were marked for specific exhibits. Our first target here was the Skywalk adventure, a part of the Trial Square section. Here one can experience piloting a helicopter with real simulator. However space being limited one needs to be fairly early to reserve slot. We were late.Â  As an alternative there was other lab activities. But we gave it a pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The huge floor to ceiling projections in the center of the gallery was showing images of our earth and environment. If alone one could take a seat and enjoy the visuals. But we were traveling with kids. So well we moved on. To a next activity showing how energy is generated from natural resources like coal, petroleum, nuclear energy, solar energy etc. Nice show, but did not lend itself to much activity. There was a scale model of a thermal energy plant, with minute details. Then there were chunks of coal, half a canister of black petrol, and a piece of mineral stone apparently containing uranium.</p>
<div id="attachment_1067" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1067" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007.jpg" alt="Energy and transportation section" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Energy and transportation section</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Credit must be given to the museum for its effort to make things interesting for all ages. Here also there was a button to press, to see how radioactive minerals glow! Then there was a big screen for kids to solve a puzzle and in the process learn how steam turns a turbine and generate electricity. There was also a game where you could control a man flying through a factory, with hopefully, learning something about the various components in a real power plant. Somewhat ambitious, but one would not complaint as it made a fair attempt at getting kids engaged and understand those things.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2nd Floor Transportation Research section</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other half of the gallery had a collection of miniature rail engines, ships, airplanes within glass showcases. The famous zero fighters and the aircraft carrier Musashi stood next to passenger plane models and military aircrafts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A part of the hall wedged between the energy gallery and the models section has been converted into a mini library. Around the library there are some exhibits that explain more fundamentals of science. Of course through interactive activities. Turn the driving wheel, see how the wheels of a car turn left or right. Matter of levers and gears and camshafts. Each of these things are further explained through separate exhibits. Lift a 10 kg weight, feels heavy especially to young hands. Engage levers, engage pulleys, and see how one can lift the same weight easily now.</p>
<div id="attachment_1058" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1058" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002.jpg" alt="Gears pulleys levers and more reading" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gears pulleys levers and more reading</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s really difficult to explain science to kid, leave alone make him enjoy and wish to come back. Mitsubishi has done a good job. However the purpose of the museum is not just to educate kids on science but also to make people aware how Mitsubishi has been at the forefront of technology and industry. So the history part does exist, and overall arrangement was constrained to areas where Mitsubishi operates. These constraints may pit it unfavorably if compared against the similar but more engaging to children science exhibitions built by Sony or Panasonic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/panasonic-risupia-science-for-kids/" target="_blank">Panaronic Risupia</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of these had the liberty of using audio visual attractions, in line with their businesses. But Mitsubishi is in core engineering area. So it gets full credits for how it weaved core engineering with its history into a museum.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Science museum Tokyo &#8211; AÂ day out for kids</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When your eight year old runs around chasing the heavy ball as it glides in its path, you know it was good outing. Science museumÂ is the place forÂ learning the sciences in the most enjoyable way possible. If you are planning to help your kid enjoy learning, you cant be wrong with a day out in Science museum.Â  Crank that shaft, push that lever, turn the pulley, things move. A chapter of mechanics done. Could things be any better?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The imposing 5 storied white building inside Kitanomarukoen, Imperial palace gardens, has a huge number of displays. And not just displays, there areÂ a large number of hands-on experiment sessions that run every hour, separately in each floor. It becomes difficult which one to choose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first floor is the ticketing area and souvenir shop. The display halls start from second floor. Each floor has about four halls with their own exhibits. A central atrium on each floor has a few minor or accompanying displays, a sitting area for the tired visitors and extended area for cafeteria.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2nd floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second floor focuses on basics of machines, and motion. One hall here has display of bicycles, starting from old wooden ones through till modern day varieties. Another hall looks at cars. Most young crowd tend to spend a good amount of time in this area as there are real driving experiences to have. One can drive a real full size truckÂ -stepping into the drivers cabin, pressing the accelerators and controlling the driving wheel! Only the truck does not move, but simulates driving with a big LCD screen showing in front as if the driver is navigating city traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then next there is a full size car with its innards bared open, covered with glass. A driver can sit, press the accelerator, turn the driving wheel. There will be real engine sound, and gears and pistons will move. There is also a motor bike with real working accelerators and turn sensors.</p>
<div id="attachment_891" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-891" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003.jpg" alt="Simulated driving of cars" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Simulated driving of cars</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another hall teaches all about levers, pulleys and forces. For that it has a full cage in the shape of a large spring circling around the hall. A heavy metal ball moves through the cage as it is pushed forward. There are obstacles in between in the cage, where the viewers have to push a lever or pull a pulley so that the ball continues to move ahead. It requires several people to work together so that the ball can move around. And these people quickly become friends helping each other with that little extra power to lift the lever and push the ball through. Then there is the pulley mechanism that allows kids to lift a whole car &#8211; a real car! And then there is the pulley and gear arrangement that lets two kids rotate two dials and move a set of sticks that beat a set of drums. All these to teach about how gears work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3rd floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor next up is the Denki floor, teaches kids about electricity. Starting with Fleming&#8217;s three finger rule, it shows in a simple but interesting way how magnets and copper wire can be used to generate electricity. Then shows how wind energy is used to generate electricity. There are ample ways to engage the youngsters. One can play with every exhibit, see how the volt meter reading changes with action. And not just volt meters, one can paddle an exercise bike that generates electricity then creates magnetism and pulls up bits of metal. Several bikes in a row with colorful display scales on the wall are enough to make a bunch of kids engage in fierce cycling and seeing who can reach the maximum height on the scales.</p>
<div id="attachment_892" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-892" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00004.jpg" alt="Earths magnetosphere and aurora" width="281" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00004.jpg 281w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00004-162x300.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Earths magnetosphere and aurora</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from such exhibits, there are live experiment classes held every hour. Care is taken to ensure the presentations are understandable to even the tiniest of participants. While being interesting to all. It&#8217;s difficult to do it, and perhaps even more difficult to explain. Let usÂ not even try to explain either, because that will be a kill joy. You shouldÂ experience it yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same 3rd floor there is a slightly different exhibit, with a curious looking sets of metal horns poking out of floor and walls. The horns are not dissimilar to the ones one see in old gramophone pictures. One is supposed to listen on the gramophone like end. These play the sound generated by earth&#8217;s magnetosphere when hit by solar plasma. Clearly in the audible range these are strange extraterrestrial sounds, somewhat hypnotic. We actually came back once more to listen to these sounds, as strange and magical as it were. You may have heard these sounds inÂ NASAÂ TV programs,Â inÂ those ones talking about deep space journeys and extra terrestrial life. In that hall there was another display again dwelling on the subject of earth&#8217;s magnetosphere and Auroras seen in north and south poles. Here it was like a movie on a giant LCD screen. Viewers could sit and see the effect of plasma rays on our atmosphere as the colors of aurora swept across the screen in a surreal display.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4th floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â The fourth floor next above focused on liquids and minerals. For kids there was this podium on which as a kid stepped, a hand cranked ring would go up enveloping him/ her in a soap bubble. Blowing the soap bubble out the kids stepped down as if a prince or princess coming off his/her magical chariot. Expect long queue here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â Same 4th floor in another hall, named Constrium, exhibits showed the latest in building construction technology.Â Â Here one could see how earth quakes occur, andÂ how Japanese buildings are engineered to absorb the shocks. We reached in time for a live experiment class that explained the different types of shock waves and their varying effects on small low rise buildings versus high rises. On a table there wereÂ two glass plates.Â The plates had a small separation allowing one to move with respect to the other.Â The lower one was made to vibrate, simulating quake waves, as the instructorÂ turned someÂ knobs. With one kind of wave the tall building wobbled, with another the short one was vibrating. The instructorÂ explained the traditional engineering how old Japanese buildings were protected with diagonally places planks between the upper and lower floors. She mentionedÂ the same principle is used in construction of the tallest building in Tokyo &#8211; the Tokyo Sky Tree. NextÂ she demonstrated how putting a little jar one third full of water at the top floor of the tall building helped reduce the effect earth quakes in the building. This is the reasonÂ the natural disasterÂ prevention booklets tell us to keep the bathtubs partially filled. Would not have realized how important this simple step is, if we did not seeÂ the demo.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5th floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But probably the most impactful exhibits were at the 5th floor optics and optical illusion area. The design patterns on a plane wall can make us think the walls are curved, or the angle of walls can make us think we are on an incline!Â These were all demonstrations of how our eyes make us perceive our surroundings. In one exhibit one stands in the center of a platform. The wall in front hadÂ a whirling design. This wall startedÂ rotatingÂ in a circle. Immediately one felt like the entire platform started moving in circle along with the wall. This was based on visual feedback.Â Instinctively our body tried to balance. But the sensory feedback from rest of the body did not support the feeling of movement, resulting in our body feeling strangely out of sync. In simple terms, we felt fooled, out of control of our own body!</p>
<div id="attachment_889" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-889" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00002.jpg" alt="Pulleys and Levers" width="281" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00002.jpg 281w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00002-162x300.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pulleys and Levers</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the floors and the halls held exhibitsÂ of that made impact in one way or the other.Â If however still your little one was Â not impressed, there isÂ the old favorite King Kong, siting in a cage. It senses movement. Kids can go up a small ladder to peek inside the cage. King Kong roars. This one does leave an impression, trust me.</p>
<p>Despite such superb collection, the center maintains a relatively low profile though compared to more recent ones like Miraikan or Â Panasonic Risupia or Sony Explora science. You can follow the links here to read more about those.</p>

<p>This center is somewhat more academic, more focusing on the fundamentals. That is not to say it is less interesting in any way. Rather one may argue to the contrary in some senses.</p>
<p>The easiest approach if going by public transport is to get down at Kudanshita station and walk for approx ten minutes. Well seven minutes, to be precise as per the center. For the latest information on exhibits, timing and prices please follow this URL</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sony Explora Science &#8211;Â its a kids day out in Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Odaiba the Tokyo shopping and entertainment island, Sony Explorascience is tucked at a corner in glistening shopping mall. An unlikely placement but then that is perhaps it&#8217;s charm. Does not make learning a tedium rather makes it more of a joy. Thus it perfectly blends in with its surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.sonyexplorascience.jp/english/" target="_blank">http://www.sonyexplorascience.jp/english/</a></p>
<div id="attachment_705" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-705" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002-231x300.jpg" alt="All smile competition" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00002.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">All smile competition</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you get inside past the ticket gate, it&#8217;s all full of touchy feely activities that prod even the crankiest one to smile. Yes smile one must as the first game itself calls for participants standing in front of a giant screen to smile. The best smile is judged by a camera and it puts a crown onto the winner! A bunch of people all smiling their best is certainly a good beginning.</p>
<div id="attachment_708" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-708" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00005-300x230.jpg" alt="One to one smile contest" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00005-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00005.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One to one smile contest</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The theme is then carried forward to the next game, where ones smile is judged comparing with day&#8217;s other contestants and a rank is assigned. As per the rank one gets to be a member of a favorite football team say of Brazil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This kind of smile contest sees some serious competition in a later game where two contestants from amongst the visitors sit next to each other facing the screen in front, and smile their teeth out.</p>
<div id="attachment_711" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-711" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00003-1-300x230.jpg" alt="Smile Winners Team" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00003-1-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00003-1.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Smile Winners Team</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The winning smiler knocks the other one out, proceeding to next stage. It&#8217;s so addictive I have seen people coming back to queue for one more attempt!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other games also are all such participative/ addictive, all using principle of light and sound as basic learning tools. There is this game of ping pong where one can strike colorful little disks which are actually projected light. Sensors sense the playerâs movement and calculate where the disk would be.</p>
<div id="attachment_709" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-709" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00004-300x230.jpg" alt="Mobile signals jumping from tower to tower" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00004-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00004.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mobile signals jumping from tower to tower</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such virtual projection based game is there in a more active way in dancing studio. Dancers dance and their movement is transferred into a screen character that dances in tune. Then there are displays where the person in front is scanned by a camera and the software places him / her in the story board being displayed on monitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In next another game a design is projected on a white board and two contestants vigorously wave their hands as if to colorÂ the design from their part of the board. Sensors sense the movement of the contestants and reflect that on the projected image as if it is being colored off. Of course one wins and that is the fun.</p>
<div id="attachment_707" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-707" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00006-300x178.jpg" alt="Color me fast" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00006-300x178.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00006.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Color me fast</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like the way light is processed through sensors, sound is also processed in some games and the output is projected either visually or through touch. So forÂ example there is a sound blob contest to make different pitch of sound. AÂ visual ball goes up / inflatesÂ / fattens as per the contestants will and the sound made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there are 3D display walls, the 3D movie hall and the experience center where participants carrying small LCD touch pads move in a room the walls of which have AÂ deep sea projected around. As if the viewer has dived down into the depths of ocean. The characters floating by can interact with the person carrying the LCD panel. At different parts of the wall creatures belonging to different oceans in the world swim past.</p>
<div id="attachment_706" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-706" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00001-300x230.jpg" alt="And the winner is..." width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00001-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SONYX00001.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">And the winner is&#8230;</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall it is a mish mash of games and learning where the learners fight to learn! Â Its a complete kids day out, for hands on learning through play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Science Playareum,Â as aÂ team couchflyer member said, a word invented in the spirit ofÂ experiment&#8230;!!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Its Science Playareum</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tepia &#8211; Fun Science Day Out for Kids in Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unavoidable fact of life &#8211; kids will ask questions. An awful lot of them, if you have a kid like ours. Solution lies not in answering or explaining, because that will inevitably lead to more questions. It is when you give them something to do through which they can find the answer themselves, their curiosity is satiated. Great men no doubt realized it long back. Result is that most big cities have got one or more science museums, observatories, ocean aquariums etc. Tokyo, being the largest city, has many. We with our pre-teens happened to find ourselves at the ticket counters of most. Yesterday it was no different, another weekend another visit to a science exhibition, only though there was no ticket gate there. Free, newly set up and partly sponsored by industrial houses, TEPIA in Omotesando area is a showcase for companies working in electronics and robotics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.tepia.jp/english" target="_blank">https://www.tepia.jp/english</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The TEPIA logo is visible right as one steps out of gate number 3 of Gaienmae station, Ginza subway line. Out of the gate, turn right, walk by the side of Meiji Jingu stadium for a few minutes, the entrance is at the right hand side. The exhibit right at the entrance lobby is a huge super-high resolution TV screen by Toshiba. Turn right, you will be facing a magic mirror. The fun starts from here.</p>
<div id="attachment_691" style="width: 397px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-691" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001.jpg" alt="Social robot Wakamaru" width="387" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001.jpg 387w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001-223x300.jpg 223w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00001-300x404.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Social robot Wakamaru</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meet Wakamaru, the bright yellow colored highly social extra terrestrial. Loves to talk, loves to take photo with you, and asks you meet him again when you come next. The cute robots continue to meet you as you step into the 2nd floor lab. But right here at 1st floor, there&#8217;s enough to keep your young ones engaged. There is a display of little robots, a couple of inches in height, walking around a small circular path, never colliding, and navigating past obstacles placed on the way. Here it is not just about what a robot can do. You must have already been to Miraikan and seen ASIMO. Or been greeted by Pepper at Softbank stores. If not read the relevant articles in this site. But here, the stress is on the social aspect of robotics. How they interact with one another and with us humans. Kind of a preview of Google car era. To help little ones feel at home with these robotÂ  peers coming soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_NDA-_ph5I" target="_blank">Pepper Robot in Softbank mobile store</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moving on, there is an Augmented reality display that offers incredible immersive experience. Engaging enough to get full family sit down on the sofa and start playing! As one waves the little video game controller pointing at the big screen in front, a pack of giggling little extra terrestrials land onto the carpet in front. These little ones wave their hands, jump and roll, kind of filling the whole carpet. Wave your hand, the little guys topple, jump aside, then gets up and makes faces at you! All funny, cutesy, super engaging. You step off the sofa, those guys move about. If those little naughty ones make you tired, just rub the controller pointing at them. A vacuum seemingly sucks them back in. Interaction can scarcely be any better than this! You need to keep some time in your hand for this exhibit as it tends to get crowded pretty soon.</p>
<div id="attachment_695" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-695" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005.jpg" alt="Augmented reality experience" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Augmented reality experience</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next there is this small room with an interactive wall. On the wall there is a scenery fromÂ  a Manga cartoon book.Â City high rises, or old village. As you stand in front, you enter the scenery. Next a series of instructions tell you a story and you choose to interact with the building, the road, the belongings. Depending on your interaction the plot moves. In a 10 minute interaction a manga cartoon story gets created with you being the central character. Cool, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<div id="attachment_690" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-690 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008-208x300.jpg" alt="Manga cartoon with starring yourself" width="208" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008-300x433.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00008.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Manga cartoon with starring yourself</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are quite a few displays like this, making you part of an interactive happening. Kids love them all. Then there was this workshop on building an electronic circuit. A new entrant after Makey makey, AGICÂ  is the maker of silver ink pens that can be used to directly draw a circuit on paper. Kids were asked to draw a square using a pen given. The square had to have a gap at the top line to house a LED lamp and another gap to house a small battery with two wires. When all connected and securely placed with cello tapes, the bulb starts glowing. So does the faces of the kids! It&#8217;s their own created circuit, they get to keep it, after suitably decorating the inside spaceÂ  of the circuit with their imagination. Box of color pens are kept there for that. Learning can be fun, a lot of fun if you are in TEPIA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://agic.cc/en" target="_blank">URL for AGIC</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it need not be only electronics. There are some displays that explain human body, some explains natural disasters such as earthquakes and how engineers are coming up with new and new ideas to protect buildings from earthquakes. Surprisingly these are also interactive. For example the exhibit that explains how a layer of air separates an apartment building from its foundation that keeps shaking due to earthquake. Using a law of physics, it shows how easy it is to levitate up a huge heavy installation. How easy? One of us stood on a platform made of two glass plates with a thin layer of liquid in between. As soon as one blew through a pipe leading to the layer in between, the upper layer of the platform lifted up. We so far blew only to blow a bubble or a balloon. Lifting a person up &#8211; never thought of it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2nd floor there is a dedicated robotics teaching center. Classes are organized regularly. Â At off times, one can see and play with creations kept as exhibits. Such as two small one wheeled robots moving about in an arena at the center of the room. Two robots which can be controlled to kick a football and score goals. A snail shaped robot that traces its path slowly around a magnetic strip. Then there are computer terminals one can access to look up a video library full of instructables.</p>
<div id="attachment_693" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-693" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003-300x300.jpg" alt="Robot snail - miles to go" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00003.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Robot snail &#8211; miles to go</p></div>
<div id="attachment_692" style="width: 214px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-692" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002-204x300.jpg" alt="Messibot vs Ronaldobot" width="204" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002-204x300.jpg 204w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002-300x440.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TEPIA00002.jpg 355w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Messibot vs Ronaldobot</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a small theater and a restaurant onSecond floor. Helpful for both kids and their parents, after a two hour round of the complex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, it&#8217;s a nice half day outing. Not as big or busy or famous as Miraikan or Sony Explora Science, but good enough to get your kids a welcome dose of science. Only regret from the younger one was that, there was not enough to do such as ride or scale up and hang down from. And from me as dad dragged out of bed on a holiday morning &#8211; the bed being shown on the huge TV alas it looked too alluring to be so not trueâ¦.</p>

<h2>Science for kids by Panasonic</h2>
<p>For most of ordinary folks like me the Panasonic brand stands for latest in audio visual products. Granted Panasonic is not just that, in fact it is leading research in areas of assisted mobility, amongst many others. It is to sensitize people like me about its wide area of activities there is this spacious well appointed Panasonic building in Odaiba.</p>
<p>Smack in the middle of shopping malls and entertainment complex, it indeed tries hard to drive home the brand message while not being neither too mall like nor too serious. The all glass and steel structureÂ  with pristine white interiors convey a kind of space age ambiance. A central atrium with race track for kids, havingÂ real time trackÂ visuals projected on a large LED wall, does indeedÂ convey a sporty brand image.</p>
<p>On one side of the hall there is aÂ little tabletop city. Comprising of garden and villasÂ  with a set of moving trains, with a cache of latest cameras kept next, is meant to appeal to latestÂ camera tech enthusiasts.</p>
<p>A path inside from the hall, with potted plants on two sides giving Â it an ambiance of a garden path, leads to a special display room. Special with vertical greenery on all the walls. It is perhaps to represent Panasonic&#8217;s interest in low energy green science.</p>
<p>In short the purpose of existence of this buildingÂ  is well justified by the careful display of modernity that subtly introduces its core business.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">But nowhere does it resortÂ  to bare advertising. In itself this concept ofÂ  gentle understatement is a welcome one amongst a world full of glaring neon signs crying me too.</span></p>
<h2>Touchy FeelyÂ Laws ofÂ Motion</h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">On top of it the 2nd and 3rd floors house Panasonic Risupia, the science hall for the young and/or curious. This element adds an additional creativity to the already well orchestrated presentation. The 2nd floor lobby right out of the elevator has a series of workstations. Children can sit and scroll through the large touch screen icons to learn about various science and nature topics. The layout of the individualÂ  desks and workspace, the overall colour combination of the sitting area oozes a creative ambience. Even the really small ones can relish in a set of imaginatively created displays set up opposite the workstations. Simple experiment on gravity, when combined with principle of shifting center of gravity, gives rise to a set of hollow wooden pucks sort of dancing down a path. Kids never tire of picking up the pucks and placing back on the top just to see those amble down in a hilarious motion. Then there are the little marbles that make a cling clang sound when rolled down a carved passage and rolling over metal plates.</span></p>
<p>But the experiments graduate to more awesome ones as you turn left from the elevator. Here more of science is at play in the different exhibits displaying the effects of gravity on different sized paths, or generation of electricity when a piece of magnet is moved through a copper coil.Â  There&#8217;s exhibits on how levers work, how conservation of momentum is visible in a set of similarly sized pendulums when swung in a set of 1, 2,3 or more. Each one is touchy feely, each experience is carefully chosen to surprise and impress. Science could not have been presented any more creatively, one might wonder.</p>
<h2>Light, Sound and Action</h2>
<div id="attachment_368" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-368" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia-300x200.jpg" alt="Panasonic Risupia" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Panasonic-Risupia.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Panasonic Risupia</p></div>
<p>But then there is the upper floor which focuses on light and sound. The 500 yen entry ticket in this floor secures a hand held unit for you.Â  This is to display a track of your exploitsÂ  in the games and exhibits, plus to let you get more info on each exhibit. Â Once doneÂ  the device automatically upload your entire experience history for you to download later at home. As you step in, you go past a set of concave convex mirrors that change you into slim or err healthy. This and other themes build up the story finally that rolled into a 3D panorama at the last display.</p>
<p>OK,Â lets take a step at a time. The next exhibit pastÂ the mirrors introduces you to concave convex lenses, using which you have to focus a picture. Then a next one lets you play with sound. With a wave of your hand you control the pitch of sound. It is visible in the shape of the wave reflected on the wall. And a further one let&#8217;s you solve a puzzle projected visually on a wall in front. Real pieces of various shaped articles need to be arranged matching the projected shape. The activity by participant is monitored and helpful hints are projected onto the wall.</p>
<p>A further more complex but an immensely popular display involves more interaction in the way of trying to arrange a set of shapes on a magnetic wall. The shapes so arranged are to guide a set of balls, projected on the wall, popping out of a tube at the top and rolling down into another open tube below. The way the shapes are placed guides realistically how the balls run down below as if the projected ball shaped lights are really 3D objects. The whole activity changes very fast, moves through levels and challenges participants based on how well they could arrange the shapes and catch the balls.</p>
<p>All such interaction finally leads to the 3D show thatÂ raises the bar on immersive experience. While we are still waiting for personal VR or AR devices, this one gives us a glimpse of how it feels to be in the midst of a projected story and interact with the objects in the story. AttendeesÂ  chosen through a quick game of &#8220;stone paper scissors&#8221; are invited onto a small stage right amongÂ the audience. As he or she steps onto the stage, the projection equipment let them step into the story. The audience gets to interact with the boys and girls in the story as the story progresses. The stories change according to the show times but the experience really changes ones perception about where science can be heading to.</p>
<p>And that is after all the intention of Panasonic Risupia, to engage and interact with its audience the common man. A half a day outing can be an enjoyable one on any day especially if it&#8217;s too hot outside or say rainy. For us the Couchflyer team it is a good outing on any day!</p>
