<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nijo castle was the residence of the Shogun in Kyoto, T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his was the place that united the land once divided into numerous fiefdoms into one country that is Nihon -Japan. </span></p>
<h3>The Singing Nightingale</h3>
<p>Japan was formally ruled by the emperor but power was concentrated in the hands of his .military general -the Shogun. Shogun set up his own administrative center in Nijo castle. Its where the he held his court. No wonder it was built to be secure as a fort with measures that included a surrounding moat and an outer and an inner perimeter fence. But the most unique feature of this castle was the state of the art defensive measure -the &#8220;singing platform&#8221;. Any potential assassin trying to tip-toe in would be detected as soon as he stepped on the floor as the floor would &#8220;sing&#8221;. This was a unique mechanism as ingenious in its engineering as scary in its message about the days political struggles.</p>

<h3>Emperor, Shogun and the Ninjas</h3>
<p>Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu was the first Shogun to have established himself as the supreme power in Japan. It was a time Japan was going through intense power struggle. Warlords fought for regional suzerainty. Hired assassins -the famed  Ninja&#8217;s &#8211; appeared in Japan&#8217;s history.  Known for their training in stealthy war craft Ninja&#8217;s were the greatest threat to Samurai lords. Nijo castle was built at this time, with this specific threat in mind. Inside the moat beyond the two perimeter walls, the inner quarters were built to alert the guards even if someone tried to tip toe on the floor. Erected from two separate layers with a series of metal spikes hanging in between , the floor would clank even under the gentlest push. This was the famous singing floor, a feat of engineering that survived through the ravages of time.</p>

<h3>The Nijo Mae</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The station next to Nijo castle is called Nijo Mae. &#8220;Mae&#8221; in Japanese means &#8220;in front&#8221;. So the easiest way to reach Nijo castle was to head to Nijo Mae station. Easy peasy, we thought. Unfortunately there are multiple surface,regional and subway lines leaving from Kyoto main railway station. Directions boards are there, but scant in number as compared to the number of lines and tourists. Moreover the entrance to the subway is a shoppers paradise. So if not careful one can get lost,like we did. Nijo showed up ts defenses even before we could approach!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In underground Google maps stopped working.. Shuffling through guidebooks, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fumbling for the right word, taking to dumb charades &#8211; did all that to finally find our way to Nijo Mae.</span></p>
<h3>Students with Notebooks</h3>
<div id="attachment_1326" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1326" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-300x300.jpg" alt="Way to the Tea Room" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to the Tea Room</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approached Nijo a further surprise awaited us. It was a school day. There were a bunch of kids in yellow caps at the crossing. As soon as the signal turned green a cockle of excited voices accompanied us to the entrance of the castle. A school excursion &#8211; explained one of the more curious kid eager to practise his English. It was to be the first of a series of interactions that day with the otherwise reticent bunch of Japanese schoolkids. It soon transpired that the kids were tasked to record visitor remarks also in their worksheets. In English. And this entire exercise was meant to make them less shy and more confident in dealing with foreigners! Japan was getting ready for Olympic 2020.  </span></p>
<h3>Castle Quarters and the Courtyards</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The castle entrance was via a bridge over a moat that surrounded the high walls. The gigantic doors opened into a wide lobby, guarded by towers. Attackers even if crossed the moat and made a successful entry would be pinned in this place by sharp shooters . Another layer of wall at its end secured the inner quarters. This is where the shogun set up his council.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1333" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1333 size-large" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Intricate carvings on wood and gold leaf" width="660" height="660" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Intricate carvings on wood and gold leaf</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors from afar, the local land lords, the lower generals, the informers, the agents each had their separate visitor room inside the elaborately decorated wooden palace. Each room had its designated seating areas with the lord being seated guarded by body guards. The rooms were exquisitely decorated. There were real gold embossed paintings of cranes in lily pond or flying high amongst the clouds. The entire building comprising of visitor rooms private rooms store rooms was constructed in a rectangular fashion, with a central courtyard opening into a lily pond. </span></p>
<h3>Palace Gardens</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the functional purpose of administrative head office, Nijo castle was also a show piece, a platform to demonstrate aristocratic finesse that only the shogun could summon. A court yard from behind the living quarters opened in to Japanese garden, with its flowing stream, and stone bridges. Walkways lined by maples and cedars meandered around the castle, During autumn, fall colors painted the area in red and yellow. A tea room at a corner at the far end, under the shadow of old cedar trees, offered a feel of peace and tranquility. Couples in Kimono walked by. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stepped path from here went up towards a terrace. The entire greater Kyoto with its blue tinged mountain ranges came into view from there.</span></p>
<h3>The Quintessential Japanese</h3>
<div id="attachment_1331" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1331 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-300x300.jpg" alt="The stone bridge over to the Japanese garden" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The stone bridge over to the Japanese garden</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1332" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1332" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-300x300.jpg" alt="Maples in garden" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Maples in garden</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This embrace of nature, this surrender to  the ephemeral and eternal contrasts sharply with the identity of Nijo, as the war lords lair. This combination of power and renunciation is what defined the Shogun era Japanese psyche. Its the one common thread that runs through the defensive fabrication of the fortress, to the intricate gold leaf drawings on palace walls,  And this contrast captured in its highest form in Nijo distinguishes it as a World Heritage Site. Yes its a must visit site.     </span></p>

<h2>Fushimi Inari</h2>
<ul>
<li>15 minutes by JR NARA line from Kyoto</li>
<li>Shrine of Hollywood fame</li>
<li>Series of red Torii or wooden gates are its main attraction</li>

<p>From Tofukuji the next station is Fushimi Inari. We started from Kyoto station. Stopped at Tofukuji. Got back into the next available train in the same direction for the next stop at Fushimi. Could we have walked ? Cycled perhaps. But the journey in the small toy train like train itself was also fun.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you cross the road, a wide paved path leads the way through huge red wooden gate. This red vermilion colored Torii is what distinguishes the Fushimi Inari from others around. FushimiInari is known for Torii. It is not just for this one but  for the hundreds that follow. The path leads to the pavilion of the main temple complex. Then moves uphill.</p>

<p>It was originally an obeisance to the foxes that protected the harvest from small pests. But faith outgrew its genesis transforming into a tradition serving a larger purpose. The legend of Fushimi Inari was born.</p>

<h2>The Shrine of Hollywood Fame</h2>
<p>Unlike Tofukuji Fushimi Inari is a busier stop. Tofukuji retains quaint Japanese temple town characters. But Fushimi Inari is a tourist magnet, well known as the location  for Hollywood movie Memoirs of a Geisha. The station as a result enjoys better documentation in English.</p>
<p>Inari temples however abound in Japan, even in Tokyo. <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/fox-god-inari-and-the-environment/">https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/fox-god-inari-and-the-environment/</a></p>
<p>So does Toriies in many Shinto shrines. Its of course the most famous Inari temple made famous by its association with Hollywood. Not otherwise nearly as pretty as compared to the richly decored Kinkakuji or blessed with fall colours such as Tofukuji. So unless trying to tick a destination off your list there is a chance one may feel underwhelmed! Beauty after all lies in the eyes of the beholder&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Visiting heritage city of Kamakura in a Day Trip from Tokyo</h2>
<p>Just an hour away from Tokyo, Kamakura is an ancient heritage town. With a sea beach and an island thrown into the mix, it has something for everyone. So for our first day trip out of Tokyo we headed to this Heritage city Kamakura to cover what maximum we could in one Day Trip from Tokyo.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d415872.57377228315!2d139.36502604325494!3d35.479432916528815!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6018459b80ac5619%3A0x5700747a399f2502!2sKamakura%2C+Kanagawa+Prefecture!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1491427532970" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The original city of Kamakura was established as a fortress town, naturally guarded on three sides by hills, approachable only from sea. Over time this town grew in importance as the top religious and social center on the east coast of Japan, second in influence only to capital Kyoto.</p>
<p>Now Kamakura is one of the busiest tourist town. As one gets down at Kamakura station, the station decor and the adjacent  spacious tourist office indicates the importance of this place as a tourist center. There are several tour circuits covering a cross section of the Buddhist and Shinto shrines. It is quite impossible to visit all the popular shrines in a day,or even in two days. So we decided to pick two routes covering the most famous of Kamakura shrines, with a quick hop to Enoshima island, if time allowed. We took the Odakyu line with Kamakura Enoden free pass.</p>

<h3>Leg 1: Dai Butsu and Hase Dera</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First on our list was Dai Butsu and Hase Dera temple. Dai Butsu, the Big Buddha, is iconic of Kamakura. And Hase Dera traces its origin back to seventh century arrival of Buddhism to Japan. This back ground, coupled with the fact that there is a direct connect to Hase by the narrow gauge Enoden line helped us choose this as our 1st destination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enoden line  has its own charm. Its is a small train that goes snaking behind terraces and kitchens, sometimes like a tram right in the middle of road, sometimes right by the sea side. Its an experience on its own. Especially for children. </span></p>
<h4>Dai Butsu- The Big Buddha</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">   Getting down at Hase station, we crossed the rail line heading towards Daibutsu. The narrow road divides at a point where the left lane goes to the great Hase Dera temple. We headed straight. First target was Dai Butsu. Traditional art and crafts shops crowd into the pavement. Shortly the entrance way shrouded in bamboo groves and maple and cedar trees appear in front. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1243" style="width: 268px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1243" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012-258x300.jpg" alt="Kamakura Dai Butsu" width="258" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012-258x300.jpg 258w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012-300x349.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kamakura Dai Butsu</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We queue for tickets. Ticket jackets describe the story of Daibutsu &#8211; the great Buddha. Its a gigantic bronze statue that survived many a tsunamis and earthquakes. Now it is surrounded by manicured Japanese garden, with shaded rest areas. As one walks through the garden past the ancient cedars, the Buddha in meditative pose comes fully into view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walk further close, up the stairs, past the incense stick stand. The Buddha had his hands folded into a mudra, eyes closed deep into introspection. There are shades  with wooded benches on all three sides. Sitting there were devotees with rosaries in hand, serious photographers, curious tourists. We walk around. Step into the garden. Garden of cedars and junipers. Shaded, calm and quiet. There was a hillock close by, with a small wooden temple at its foot. On a side there is a souvenir shop. Visitors bought incense sticks to offer with prayer.  Pretentious human existence suddenly appeared so small.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was this tunnel beneath the Daibutsu statue. It led inside the statue. A few narrow dark steps ends at a small platform. There was nothing much to see. Just satiated curiosity. We stepped out and sat down on the wooden benches under the shade. Let go of the tiredness. Started early in the day, packing, rushing, huffing and puffing boarding the train at Shinjuku station. Then squeezing into the Enoden train. Finally following the crowd to Dai Butsu. At last we are there. Read about it, always wanted to see. </span></p>
<h4>Hase Dera</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From Daibutsu we headed back walking towards the junction where the road forked. This time took the one heading to Hase Dera. This road was narrow, claimed both by pedestrians and cars and tourist buses. So had to stop and go. There were craft shops, antique shops and restaurants all jostling for attention on the two sides. The ambiance changes once you walk up to the gate of Hase Dera.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1259" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1259" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028-227x300.jpg" alt="Hase Dera Entrance" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028-300x396.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hase Dera Entrance</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1261" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1261" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00030-300x227.jpg" alt="Stepping inside Hase Dera " width="300" height="227" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00030-300x227.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00030.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Stepping inside Hase Dera</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tera or Dera means (Buddhist) temple. Legend has it that in the eighth century a monk dreamt of a log floating in by the sea. He actually found that log in the morning and enshrined it as god. Over time its fame spread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right inside past the entry gate, a Japanese garden, with a stream and a lily pond, welcomes you. Through the floating leaves colored fishes swim by. A bridge crosses the stream to the base of a stone stair. The steps lead to landing, with a small temple, then goes further up to the main temple complex at the hill top.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1258" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1258" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00027-300x227.jpg" alt="Traditional Japanese garden in Hase Dera" width="300" height="227" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00027-300x227.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00027.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Traditional Japanese garden in Hase Dera</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1257" style="width: 292px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1257 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026-282x300.jpg" alt="Colored fishes swimming in Hase Dera stream" width="282" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026-282x300.jpg 282w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026-300x319.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Colored fishes swimming in Hase Dera stream</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temple was originally by the shore, but over time residences cropped up all around. The view from the top though is still beautiful. The entire shore comes into view,  with fishing boats here and there and few hazy outlines of ships in the distance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1271" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1271" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200005.jpg" alt="Buddha in meditation -statue in garden" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200005.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200005-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Buddha in meditation -statue in garden</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1269" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1269" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200003-300x227.jpg" alt="Temple with a prayer wheel " width="300" height="227" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200003-300x227.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200003.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Temple with a prayer wheel</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A giant prayer wheel is there in an adjacent hall, with its own Japanese garden, lily pond, little bridge and stone paved path. For the curious, and untired, there are some more but smaller temples a little walk away towards the rear boundary. And there is a cave too, walk-able up to a distance.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1240" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1240" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009-227x300.jpg" alt="Goldleaf Buddha in Hase Dera" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009-300x396.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Goldleaf Buddha in Hase Dera</p></div>
<p>We explored around for sometime. The sun got stronger. In summer the sandy sea side heats up quickly. We step inside the main temple hall. It was dark, torched partially by the hundreds of candles lit. The golden Buddha is silent deep in meditation. Occasional drum beats, gong of the temple bell, flickering candle light, all helped bring up an imagery of a thousand years gone by. You don&#8217;t need to be a believer. The ambiance sweeps you in.</p>
<h3>Leg 2: Hachimangu and Hokokuji</h3>
<p>From Hase station we head back to Kamakura. The road out of the rail station crosses the city bus stop. This time our destination is Hachimangu, Its walkable from station. So we cross the bus stop. And merge into the central arterial road of Kamakura. This road has been there for some thousand years at least. Emerging from the sea shore it heads straight on to the stairs of Hachimangu, dissecting the city into East and West. The city life revolved around this temple.</p>
<h4>Tsurugaouka Hachimangu Shrine</h4>
<p>Hachimangu was the cultural and social epicenter. The stairs of Hachimangu have seen major power struggle and blood letting. The East and West sides had traditionally been strongholds of two opposing Samurai clans. Stories of their valor and struggle made these portals of Hachimangu part of Japanese lore. There are lily ponds on the two sides of Hachimangu, named after the two clans.</p>
<div id="attachment_1236" style="width: 582px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1236" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00004.jpg" alt="Hachimangu Temple" width="572" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00004.jpg 572w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00004-300x263.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hachimangu Temple</p></div>
<p>None of the old are there any more, but it&#8217;s history as the power center and the family temple of Shogun has bestowed an unmistakable aura to Hachimangu. The city of today still centers around it.</p>
<p>But in last few centuries there have been major events that shook Japan. Meiji revolution, world war. Fall of the shoguns, rise of the emperor, Japans rise as colonial power, followed by eventual fall. Somewhere through this the once glorious Kamakura lost out. So did Hachimangu. The huge complex that was there once upon a time is barely discernible now.</p>
<div id="attachment_1239" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1239" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00007-300x242.jpg" alt="Rickshaws for tourists Kamakura" width="300" height="242" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00007-300x242.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00007.jpg 622w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rickshaws for tourists Kamakura</p></div>
<p>Tourists have replaced the devotees. Flashy souvenir shops, upscale restaurants and travel operator signboards adorn the two sides of the road to Hachimangu. The main thoroughfare takes a boulevard appearance as it heads out from the station. Tradition is still valued, and followed, but packaged in a very modern getup. Rickshaws still ply, only if as tourist attraction.</p>
<div id="attachment_1237" style="width: 246px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1237" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005-236x300.jpg" alt="Lily ponds of Hachimangu" width="236" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005-236x300.jpg 236w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005-300x382.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lily ponds of Hachimangu</p></div>
<p>In about ten minutes we reach the shrine entrance. Vermilion colored Tori gates. Old stone bridge. The main temple visible at a distance ahead. We make our way through the crowd. Foreign tourists, locals, busy taking selfies. Occasional claps follow a reverential bow.</p>
<p>Some festival was going on the day we went. There were a few shops selling traditional gyoza (dumplings) on the two sides. From the main approach road a street forks out to the right. Priests quarters. A red bridge on the left leads to a lily pond. We headed straight towards the stairs.</p>
<div id="attachment_1272" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1272" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00003-300x227.jpg" alt="Marriage ceremony at Hachimangu" width="300" height="227" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00003-300x227.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00003.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Marriage ceremony at Hachimangu</p></div>
<p>From a distance we could hear traditional musical instrument playing. A marriage ceremony was being held. Social ceremonies are held in the ceremony hall at the base of the stairs, facing the temple entrance. Tourists with cameras were recording the proceedings. Bride, groom and their guests in bridal best were seated on the two sides. The head priest in the middle was chanting shlokas. Offerings of fruits and sweets were kept on a table facing the temple pulpit.</p>
<div id="attachment_1256" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1256" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025.jpg" alt="The old bridge of Hachimangu" width="502" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025.jpg 502w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025-300x299.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The old bridge of Hachimangu</p></div>
<p>We stopped for a while, then took the stairs up. Stepped past the Tori gate into the inner sanctorum. A ceremonial function was being held in an adjacent hall. It was certainly some auspicious day. Police were controlling the crowd. Most of the heavy wooden doors around leading to the inner halls were closed to ordinary visitors. An open side pavilion stood there, with a display of richly decorated mikoshis, kept ready for special occasions.</p>
<div id="attachment_1248" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1248" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017.jpg" alt="Offerings and prayer -Hachimangu" width="501" height="661" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017-300x396.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Offerings and prayer -Hachimangu</p></div>
<p>We stepped out. Into the open space at the top of the stairs. A wide angle view of the entire complex is available from this point. Perhaps hundreds of years ago here the Shoguns stood, addressing followers from this very step!</p>
<p>We take a side walk on the way down. The marriage ceremony was over by then. Guests in their ceremonial dresses were still sticking around taking a few more snaps. Wandering further to the left we reach a tree-shaded area, covered with Japanese maples, cedars, and bamboo groves. A small rivulet, with a wooden bridge, comes into view. We were short of time otherwise would have loved to spend some more time there.</p>
<p>We moved on crossing the bridge, not quite sure going where but carried on to see what follows. The passage wound its way out into an opening that ended at a lily pond. One of the two belonging to the warrior clans. Colored fishes here were comfortable with tourists, eagerly posing in front. Almost jostling for the best location. Same goes for the flocks of pigeons that flew down from somewhere. None afraid of human presence. Rather expected to be fed, petted, photographed. A practice perhaps for over a thousand years.</p>
<h4>Hokokuji</h4>
<p>Next on our list was Hokokuji. Famous for its tea house housed in a bamboo grove. The tea house is at the end of a cobbled stone walkway that winds behind the main temple. It passes by a zen garden. Passes by an area where from you can see old caves on the hill side. Now prohibited, separated by wire mesh, but perhaps a thousand or so years ago these caves were humble dwellings for the temple hermits. This temple traces its history to the time the original settlers established the town of Kamakura. It was extended and taken care of by later era Shogun clans who converted it into their family temple.</p>

<div id="attachment_1249" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1249" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018-227x300.jpg" alt="Neighborhood entrance at Hokokuji" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018-300x396.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Neighborhood entrance at Hokokuji</p></div>
<p>Unlike Hachimangu, Hokokuji is somewhat off the tourist center of Kamakura, being reachable only by bus. But rather than being a disadvantage, that has perhaps helped preserve its originality. The walkway to the temple is through a rustic neighborhood. Seems to be just waking up from its village past. The path way to the temple is rather narrow. Traffic sergeants at the two ends warn tourists when a car approaches. Moss and fern covers some portion of walls of the neighborhood houses. Hasty patches of cement work covers others that gave way under age.</p>
<p>But once inside the temple gates, one forgets all that was left outside. Velvet green moss covered garden, with a Buddha, beckons. Japanese maple branches curl up around stone boulders. Spring water dribbles down a water fountain. Wooden ladles kept to wash oneself before entering the inner precincts..</p>
<div id="attachment_1250" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1250" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00019-227x300.jpg" alt="The caves at Hokokuji" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00019-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00019-300x396.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00019.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The caves at Hokokuji</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1247" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1247" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00016-300x300.jpg" alt="Moss covered statuettes of hermits" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00016-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00016-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00016.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Moss covered statuettes of hermits</p></div>
<p>Past the ticket gate, the Zen rock garden comes into view. The walk way bends here and there. Goes past stone statuettes, covered in green moss. At one point one can see the caves on the hill side. The walkway makes its serpentine way further ahead. Now through a bamboo grove. Ends at a tea house. This is Hokokuji.</p>
<p>We spend some time here. Allowing our imaginations a free run through time. Who were the folks who came for prayers here, over the past hundreds of years? Celebrating their life events &#8211; birth of a child, marriage, death. Generation after generation. Would somebody from amongst my descendants also come visit this place one day? Would he or she realize that I was here, and imagined about him/her coming back to this place?</p>
<div id="attachment_1241" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1241" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00010.jpg" alt="Bamboo grove Hokokuji" width="501" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00010.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00010-203x300.jpg 203w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00010-300x444.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bamboo grove Hokokuji</p></div>

<p>Hunger breaks the stupor. It was already well past our usual lunch hour. We rush back,to grab a quick grub.</p>
<h3>Leg 3: Enoshima</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post lunch, we again board the Enoden train, this time getting down at Enoshima station. Our day pass is used to its maximum. As we walked down towards the beach, the roadside characteristics gradually change. From the heritage temple town to hip and happening US West. Most houses looked like they were lifted straight out off some American soap &#8211; the red bricks, the curved railing etc. Even the trees were no longer maple or juniper but palms &#8211; beach side palms! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main road running by the beach was wide. Seafront apartments with balconies could easily give one the impression of being in California, Florida or Hawaii. Orange hued stone walled restaurants greet tourists with &#8220;Aloha&#8221; in neon. Surfing boards dry on the sand. Beach side shacks play music, dish out seafood with beer. Young guys and gals on skate boards zoom past. </span></p>
<p>Checked the time. It was 3 o clock in the afternoon. Just in time for the last ticket sale for the <span style="font-weight: 400;">dolphin show in the sea life park &#8211; the enoshima aquarium. Famed for its Dolphin show, but its collection of sea anemones, jelly fishes, sting rays and sharks are also varied. For kids there&#8217;s a touch and feel section, to experience how it feels to touch a sea cucumber or a star fish! There is also a deep water submersible that was once used by Japan for ocean research. Outside the halls, in the open deck overlooking the ocean shore, there are telescopes to view ships anchored in the distance. Certainly the aquarium merited a whole day on its own but we were short of time. So sped through from hall to hall, to finally flop down for the dolphin show.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yqqVPI1ns3c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.enosui.com/en/" target="_blank">Enoshima Aquarium website</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the show ended, evening was setting in. Evening glow reflected in the sea. Restaurant lights came up. We walked along the beach. Reached the bridge that connects main land with Enoshima island. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1246" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1246" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015.jpg" alt="Evening glow on the Kamakura beach" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Evening glow on the Kamakura beach</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Surf boarders, sail boarders were heading home after the day&#8217;s play. We crossed the bridge. Reached the point where from a road goes up an incline to the temple at the island top.  The two sides of the street are lined with souvenir shops. And eateries. Fresh grilled food. Ice cream. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The usually colorful Japanese fan and handbag shops look more colorful in the evening light.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1120" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1120" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg" alt="Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further into the island there were caves one could visit. But it was already late evening and the chill in the air set in. Sea gulls were hovering above for the last bits before retiring for the night. It was a long day. We were tired. But it was a memorable day well worth a second visit. In a little while we were speeding down in super express train zooming past the suburban stations. Half asleep half deep in thought as we headed back home to Tokyo. Hectic, but memorable one day trip to Kamakura.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2> Galaxcity Is Galaxy Full of Fun For Kids Day Out In Tokyo</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Touch wood Tokyo weather is generally pleasant. But there are days when it&#8217;s cold and rainy. Now what do you do if it&#8217;s cold and rainy, and you have kids who so looked forward to a days outing on weekend. It&#8217;s tough. </span>For such hard times GalaxCity comes to your rescue. It&#8217;s indoor but Indoor does not mean video games. No, nope. It&#8217;s full of activities, like scaling up a rock climbing wall, learning about planets and space, making creative use of paper and stuff. in short, as the name says, its a galaxy of fun for kids day out in Tokyo. And it&#8217;s all provided courtesy city municipality. Read on if you are interested.</p>
<div id="attachment_1287" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1287" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-300x300.jpg" alt="Learning about space and asteroids" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00005.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Learning about space and asteroids</p></div>
<h3>The Planetarium</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rin and Paku, the two kids separated from their family. They were born in tough times. Like just when young Rin flopped out of her egg shell, she was attacked by a hungry Tyrannosaur! Thankfully mom reached just in time!. But mommy had to mind a cackle of kids. So Rin soon again found herself lost. winter setting in there was little that Rin could do. After all the place was Alaska, known to have particularly severe winter. Luckily she found Paku, a member from her brood. Together they braved some really tough winter. And a deadly encounter with another monstrous Tyrannosaur. Rin was picked up hanging by the jaws. Just in time Paku the braveheart came running and lunged at the tyrant. The blow threw the mean beast into cold icy water. Then spring came. Good times followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the story projected on a huge planetarium wall. Mixed with oodles of knowledge bits on evolution of earth and the solar system, how seasons change with earth&#8217;s orbit, and about evolution of life. Which kid do you think would not love it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the kids parents, the low low prices were an added surprise. A full planetarium in the middle of the busy Adachi city. screening various shows on space, rockets, animals, adventure etc etc. for a coin! Yeah one felt Happy to have paid taxes, for once.</span><br />

<h3>Net Athletics Zone</h3>
<div id="attachment_1284" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1284 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002.jpg" alt="The Galaxcity Net Athletics Zone" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Galaxcity Net Athletics Zone &#8211; full of fun day for kids in Adachi Tokyo</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this planetarium was just an added bonus, Icing on the cake. If your kids love to play, jump, run, then you should first hit the central hall. It&#8217;s a three storied high world made of nets. Nets make the first floor, the second, the third. Connected through chutes, made of nets. Kids can jump a la trampoline style. Go up an incline and slide down. Or simply lie down like on a hammock and enjoy the vibrations courtesy others.</span></p>
<h3>The Climbing Wall</h3>
<div id="attachment_1289" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1289" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007.jpg" alt="The Climbing Wall" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Climbing Wall</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is not enough, then go for the climbing wall. Three story high, with safety harness, helmets, belaying cable. instructors using laser pointers to guide the young mountaineers to the next best hold.</span></p>
<h3>Digital Play</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, if your kid is still too young for climbing, how about some learning through digital play? There&#8217;s a room with two screens for engaging the younger ones. On the first, letters fall from a tree, like leaves in fall. The kids have to catch the letters that make up particular word. The word is shown in the beginning. Hang on, it&#8217;s not just that. The word is not written as it is but a picture is shown. The kid has to get the word and then catch the falling letters in sequence. As is expected the letters fall all over the place, just like fall leaves on a breezy day. So kids need to move/jump/run a bit to catch.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1286" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1286 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004.jpg" alt="Digital Play" width="741" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00004-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Digital Play</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next screen projects a collection of colored shapes. The more active the kid standing in front, the more colors come up. </span></p>
<h3>For The Creative Ones</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next out there, there are a couple of painting and craft making rooms. The creative ones will love the bright spacious rooms, with several tables in each. Parents and children are free to pick up the art objects or craft items. Instructors are there, too.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1285" style="width: 164px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1285 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-154x300.jpg" alt="Art and Craft classes" width="154" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003-300x583.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GALAX00003.jpg 381w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Art and Craft classes</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is still one more &#8211; a baby&#8217;s play pen. Secure, colorful, soft matted, with plenty of space to crawl about.</span></p>
<h3>Essential Bits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Do you agree all the above makes for a cool day out? If still wondering about stuff such as food, then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">worry not, that also is taken care of nicely. An attached restaurant right outside serves yummy dishes like curry rice, chicken rice, pasta, sandwiches in a well lit colorful setting. Of course vending machines are there at every floor, as you would surely expected.</span></p>
<p>One caveat &#8211; you need to reach early and buy tickets early otherwise space fills up soon. Secondly, socks is a must everywhere. And thirdly no skirts/frocks only trousers. Oh yes its not so touristy so Nihongo dake de onegai shimas (guides speak only Japanese) &#8230;</p>
<p>For booking and latest shows refer to the website</p>
<p><a href="http://www.galaxcity.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.galaxcity.jp/</a></p>
<h3>More Choices</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one thing about this Galaxcity is that it&#8217;s slightly off the main Tokyo city amusement / shopping areas. If you wanted to combine shopping then check <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/kids-day-out-in-tokyo-science-playareum/" target="_blank">Sony ExploraScience</a> or <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/panasonic-risupia-science-for-kids/" target="_blank">Panasonic Risupia</a> in Odaiba. Or full play and only play, then head to Children&#8217;s world in Shibuya. On the other hand if a day full of learning is the demand, then check out <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/science-museum-tokyo-dayout-for-kids/" target="_blank">Science Museum</a>. Did somebody just say what to do it&#8217;s raining on a weekend …?</span></p>

<h3>Tree Climbing as a sport arrives in Tokyo</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are everywhere &#8211; clambering up, swaying from a branch, or just hanging. Waving at the viewers below. Boys and girls, young or err no so young. Everybody trying their hands, and legs, at tree climbing as this latest craze hits Tokyo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days when one would scan  the neighborhood trees for ripe fruits on the way to school. And launch assault on the way back. Cuts and bruises were part of the game. The odd broken limb was when things didn&#8217;t work to plan. That was it, simple pleasures of simple times.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But times changed. Sophistication has changed the approach if not the urge.  Apparently tree climbing  is still fun. Lots of fun. Provided you are part of a registered organization with necessary safety gear and licenses to operate. It&#8217;s a recognized sport. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1217"></span></p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Tree climbing as a sport evolved first in the Wild West. There is a Wikipedia  entry as well. It kinda says tree climbing evolved even before there was internet! Back in the nineteen hundred and eighties! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has gained popularity recently. Now there is an international governing body &#8211; Tree Climbers Internal Inc. (TCI) With branches in USA Canada UK Australia Malaysia China Japan Indonesia etc. Global Organization of Tree Climbers (GOTC) is mandated with the task of framing standards and certifying local bodies. After all it involves all the nitty gritties of mountain climbing, with climbing-harnesses, carabiners, and an assorted bunch of ropes being tools of the trade. One needs to learn various knots frequently used is mountaineering such as Munter Hitch, Prussic Knots and others such. Helmet, gloves and eye protection glasses are also needed, in case you wondered. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What is it really like</strong><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s really not that difficult after all. At least that is what one felt having attended one such climbing session recently held in Tokyo. Kids lined up grouped into batches for a two hour session each. In this session they were introduced to the techniques of how to climb up, and belay down, with the assortment of ropes and knots already set up for them by the organizers Tree Climbing Japan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK let&#8217;s take a close look. The rule book  requires one to first find a tree with sturdy branches. Then Get under one branch  that does not have leaves obstructing the way up. Aim high and fling a rope long enough to coil around the branch and come hanging down. Pull it tight. Fix one end of the rope with a weight. And  attach a carabiner at the other end. Take a smaller rope, fix one end to the same carabiner and another end to the longer rope knotted in such a way that it can move up or down. This is the cord that will help you get up or down. Move the knot up, it pulls you up. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Knots and hitches</strong><br />
</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here the trick is in how you tie this knot. It&#8217;s called a Prusic knot. When slack it can be moved up or down sliding on the main rope. But if there&#8217;s a pull then it tightly clutches the rope. When you fix the carabiner to your harness, and push the Prusic knot up, you are basically hanging down from this knot. If this were not gripping the main rope tightly enough you would slide down. So the better is the knot, the safer you are. To be extra safe climbers tie additional knots on the main rope that can work as a break  in case somehow the Prusic knot fails to hold. These breaks are tied at intervals as the climber goes up. And untied with a pull on the way back down. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Pushing up </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To push up you use a cord as foot board. It one smaller cord that is tied a little below the Prusic knot. This also is a Prusic knot, a smaller one  that can slide up or down the main rope. It is tied together at the two ends so that it forms a loop. This is the foot rest. Climber pushes on the foot rest to go up. Then loosens the main knot and pushes that up. It is the next stop where the climbers weight will hold it tight. Next the climber pulls the foot rest up, pushes it down with his foot. This rope works as a ladder for him. He steps on it to lift himself up. Then again he moves the main knot once more upwards. And follows this motion to climb up all the way to the branch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A weekend family trip to Mt Fuji Lake Kawaguchiko Lake Saiko Asama Shrine Wind Cave and Yoshino Sato</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather this year has been rather unusual. No summer, just rain. Apparently the second wettest season in recorded history of Japan. The wettest was the year 1961 when heavy typhoon triggered massive landslides destroying what was known as the most beautiful village of Japan. It was beside lake Saiko facing Mt Fuji. We will talk more about it later here. The route to lake Saiko starts from the hilly rail station of Lake Kawaguchiko. Asama shrine is within a short distance of Kawaguchiko station.  Wind cave falls on the way to Yoshino Sato village. These are the top 5 sites you must visit if going on a weekend trip to Fuji 5 lakes area. And got a family with kids. And looking for a refreshing break not a hurried rush.  That is how this awesome 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji five lakes area happened. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<div id="attachment_1168" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1168 size-full" title="Recommended 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji 5 Lakes area" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights.jpg" alt="Recommended 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji 5 Lakes area" width="391" height="155" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights.jpg 391w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights-300x119.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights-390x155.jpg 390w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Recommended 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji five lakes area</p></div>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A bit of Intro</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fuji five lakes formed several thousand years ago, due to a volcanic eruption. Rivers blocked turned into lakes. Dense forest now covers most of the peaks around, except Mt.Fuji which is currently dormant but have a hot underlayer spewing sulphuric vapors through the porous upper layer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without any green cover, having uniform gradient on all sides, Mt Fuji looks more like an engineered structure , rather than a natural formation. The 3776 M high peak rises gradually up all the way from near sea level. Visible from as far as Tokyo this imposing giant has been revered across Japan as the seat of the heavens. A sight to cherish a place to honor. The five lakes around it formed a beautiful surrounding. On clear days the reflection of the peak on the waters of Lake Kawaguichiko, the largest of the five lakes, inspire tired souls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Journey Starts &#8211; 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji five lakes</h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbxZk7YMtVA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time we were to stay at a lakeside cottage by the lake Kawaguchiko. And decided to take local bus trips to places around. Itinerary included this village Yoshin Sato known as Japan&#8217;s most beautiful village. And also the lava caves formed thousands of years ago around lake Saiko. If one is visiting Japan for a month or more then visiting Mt Fuji is a natural thing. Booking a two story cottage having a clear view of Mt Fuji from the onsen or the garden &#8211; it just happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the unusually heavy rain all through the summer months worried us. The weather seemed ready to spoil all plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">just the day before departure the sky cleared. Prediction for the weekend was sunny! When we reached hotel our host greeted us saying this would be only the 5th or 6th times in the entire previous two months when Mt Fuji was expected to be visible! And man how awesome that can be. We were to discover soon.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">By train or bus &#8211; 2 hours</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Shinjuku all highway buses were full. Thanks to satellite weather monitoring the entire Tokyo knew this was The weekend to go visit Mt Fuji and its five lakes. Car rental was also out of question. The only other but costlier option was to buy train tickets. By the way when someone says costly in Japan you better mind it. Some stuff otherwise normal outside can cost an arm and a leg in Japan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be that as it may, journey by train meant it was more spacious. When you have kids you know what a difference to your travel experience it can make.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are we there yet? Well ah &#8230;look there&#8217;s that nice car you see we are going faster than that … Can&#8217;t you see? A chocolate ? No, candy? She has got the larger one…</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1st  of top 5 sights &#8211; the Kachi Kachi Ropeway</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Train we boarded was direct to Kawaguchiko. Within Two hours we were at destination. Recharged selves with fresh hot bowls of udon and curry rice. Luggage at station locker, we boarded the local Red line bus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First point of interest was Kachi Kachi Ropeway. Walkable from station. But we are couch flyers, walking is too much work. Unfortunately, the bus encountered a group of tourists from some other Far East Asian country. All 11 of them. the bus could accommodate barely 2 more. Negotiation started &#8211; 2 more not 8 more? Are you sure? Ah what did you say &#8211; Yes? Home country norms understandably dictated the outcome. Did you ever feel jealous of canned sardines before ?</p>
<div id="attachment_1145" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1145 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004.jpg" alt="The Kawaguchiko Cruise" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Kawaguchiko Cruise</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kachi Kachi was a nice change. The sun was already turning orange. Fuji in the silhouette, it&#8217;s entire form as if a gentle giant rising from earth. Customary photo done we headed for the steamer station below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The 2nd &#8211; Lake Kawaguchiko cruise</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hill regions tend to draw into darkness sooner. The long shadows of the peaks around Fuji fell on lake Kawaguchiko. In between the water sparkled, colored in Orange Afternoon glow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Viewing the surroundings from the open deck of the steamer, one could see the huge Mt Fuji standing tall amongst the blue-grey mountain ranges in the horizon. Few tourists were rowing the small boats. Cranes flying back. Evening was about to set in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Headed back to Kawaguchiko station. Collected luggage, waited for the pick up van from hotel. Ours was a serviced cottage. We picked up groceries from Ogino, the local supermarket. The warm wood paneled two storied cottage with heated floor felt so welcoming! A quick trip to the covered in-premise onsen, and we were in dreamland.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>
<p><span id="more-1140"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Day 2 a clear morning</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QA1w_3fm36k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next morning was bright. Headed towards the lake, a 3 minutes walk. Autumn Sun rays were gently brushing the lake. A layer of Mist still covered the lake surface. One or two fishermen already were out with their boats. Fuji was yet not visible. Drew in deep breathes. Such freshness.</p>
<div id="attachment_1164" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1164" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006.jpg" alt="Dawn breaking on Mt Fuji" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dawn breaking on Mt Fuji</p></div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sight #3 &#8211; The magnificent Asama Shrine</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After breakfast checked out. Kept the luggage with the hotel. Walked towards Asama shrine. Said to be twelve hundred years old it is remarkable due to the giant cedars in its premises. An ambiance of peace and quietude reigned. Sound of a nearby waterfall was the only sound that could be heard. Apart from our own footsteps. Barely any visitor. The vermilion colored huge entrance gate -the Torii -seemed standing there lost in its own.</p>
<div id="attachment_1160" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1160" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008.jpg" alt="Asama Shrine and the 1200 year old cedars" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Asama Shrine and the 1200 year old cedars</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shrine was hidden amongst the tall pines and the cedars. Cedars were planted in formation mimicking the Big Dipper constellation. Why ? Nobody has an answer. The cedars themselves &#8211; Giant, aged, experienced, but alas, silent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An old person came out from a nearby shop. Curious he asked us where we are from what are we for in Japan etc. Then slid into a monologue about how great this shrine once was &#8211; it&#8217;s history, tradition. With childish Enthusiasm he went ahead up to the shrine porch, pushed a door ajar. A ginormous paper lantern hung. Door shut, another door opened. A mikoshi, richly decorated, colors somewhat paled, came into view. It&#8217;s a wooden shrine carried on shoulders by devotees around neighborhood, He explained many things. But unfortunately our limited vocabulary, and time, drew the conversation to closure. Wish we planned better!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were dropped back to Kawaguchiko station courtesy hotel pickup and drop off service. This time another two tourists were in the van. sounded French to us, if not Greek. We were to get into Greenline bus today. Redlines travel locally around Kawaguchiko. Green lines cover a larger tourist circle, including lake Saiko.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Next leg by Green line &#8211; all the way to Lake Saiko</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In such trips normally we take care to mark a nearby Combini &#8211; Japan&#8217;s ubiquitous neighborhood convenient stores selling everything. For us combinis have stood there in all times good or bad. In the beginning When what&#8217;s your name was too difficult a question to comprehend. And then now and then providing us with hot meals when we are too tired. Or just lazy.. Cakes/pasta/curry rice/ cup noodles &#8211; good enough. Though certainly not good enough for you planning to relish a leisurely meal. A proper restaurant served meal. Kawaguchiko station area for that matter is not the best place anyway. We picked up our grub from the Combini right outside. Stood in queue for Greenline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one ticket for redline also works for Greenline. Both economical and convenient. Didn&#8217;t have to wait long. Soon we were out into the less touristy more natural surroundings of the greater Kawaguchiko area. Cottages by the lakeside, fishing boats, and blue lake reflecting images of green peaks. forest still dense in certain areas, roots covered by algae fed by fresh rain, part of the Aokigahara forest land.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Destination # 4 &#8211; Wind Cave</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our first destination in this leg of the trip was wind cave. A lava cave formed after the bubbles in the cooling lava burst. Said to be of lower gradient, safe for kids and senior citizens. Part of the cave complex that opens at other end known as ice cave. Hidden in forest under ground, these caves stay cold through the out the year. Icy stalactites form inside the Ice cave in winter. The locals used to store grains and silk cocoons. Introduction of Commercial refrigerators led to gradual disuse. But now the tourism authority has taken over. tourists visit in droves. Electrical Lights, stairs, a more or less paved passageway helps navigate inside. Grains and silk cocoons are still kept inside, only for demonstration though.</p>
<div id="attachment_1165" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1165" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009.jpg" alt="Wind cave near Lake Saiko" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wind cave near Lake Saiko</p></div>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">A bit about the bus stop &#8211; sorry solved the puzzle!</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greenline bus reaches wind cave passing by the bat cave and the beautiful village known as Yoshino no Sato.Greenlines makes a loop around Yoshino Sato, right before visiting the wind cave and again right after.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Somewhat like USA??!</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From bus stop we crossed the road and walked a short distance to the ticket gate. The entire area is covered in green forest. Save for the grass covered parking area outside the forest entrance. Kept reminding me of our trip to the Kentucky caves, USA. Only this area perhaps receives much more rain. So the tree roots are covered in moss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wind cave indeed was as exciting as we expected. Not too difficult. entry was two flights of stairs down. Usually Rain drenched, needed careful steps. challenge was the low ceiling. Lights did show warnings at critical places. The navigable path inside was just about fifty feet or so. Thereafter it narrowed further making it difficult for normal tourists. Spelunking enthusiasts may continue though, perhaps emerging out at the ice cave end. Ice cave can also be reached by a well marked path from a point near the ticket gate. Other option in case you are interested is to take a bus to the next stop around the forest. We didn&#8217;t. not this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Headed back to the same Redline bus stop where we got down across the road. Today&#8217;s next destination &#8211; Yoshino Sato.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Experience #5 &#8211; Yoshino Sato</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bus dropped us at a stop next to a narrow river. It&#8217;s a wide plain valley, surrounded by peaks. The river runs a short distance before meeting lake Saiko. Color of water in lake Saiko is green, the color of the forest covered hill ranges. Yoshino Sato village is a little walk up. Down here in the valley there is a small market next to the bus stop. It caters to the villagers and tourists alike. Roasted corns, grilled fish on a stick, fresh farm produce. touristy brick a brack. Asked the owner of the shop selling polished chips of colored stones as jewelry &#8211; are these sourced locally? A sheepish smile was the only answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way to village went up by the side of the stream. It is October. white blooms of kans grass (saccharum spontaneum) filled the two sides. Ripe pumpkins in the vegetable patches reminded Halloween was approaching. The sky appeared extra blue.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">It is all about the experience&#8230;</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoshino Sato is described as the most beautiful village in Japan. It is a collection of thatched roof cottages. With gardens, stream, small bridges, and narrow winding pathways. Mt Fuji is right in front, covering the entire horizon from one side to the other! The village is virtually in its lap. On its other sides the greenish blue hill ranges extend as far as eyes can see. One British foreign ambassador compared it with Switzerland. No exaggeration here. we did feel as if we went back to somewhere in the Interlaken area. Picture perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_1161" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1161" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011.jpg" alt="View from around Yoshino Sato" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View from around Yoshino Sato</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a kimono rental available in one of the cottages. Very thoughtfully it also offers rental for men. gorgeous samurai dress with armour headgear and sword! At a Very reasonable price. There was a queue. Queue for rental. Queue for taking photos at the best location &#8211; on the bridge over the stream with Mt Fuji in the background. Queues discourage some, but not our could-be queen. Statutory photos done, returned dress and headed for the other cottages. Each cottage serves to showcase some form of traditional Japanese art and craft. Wood craft, paper making, clay modeling etc. visitors can participate, and buy. Run under supervision by tourism authorities.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">And a bit of tragedy mixed&#8230;</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Originally the village was much larger. But the 1961 typhoon triggered major landslide destroying much of life and property. We sneaked in this one and that one, without really any particular interest. The day&#8217;s journey was beginning to take its toll. but then our junior most member came running up to us excitedly pointing to an yard between two cottages few feet below. Some kids, as well as their moms and dads were walking around on stilts! Well trying,mostly. Appeared that stilt walking was a tradition in these areas. To help tourists have a feel of the times the authorities kindly kept a few stilts. Both junior and senior sizes. Free to try. And so we did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By this time the sky turned orange. The peaks on the western horizon cast long shadows. Top of Mt. Fuji was no longer visible, covered in clouds. Time to return.</p>
<div id="attachment_1151" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1151" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00010.jpg" alt="Yoshino sato a picture postcard village" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00010.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00010-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yoshino sato a picture postcard village</p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Journey ends &#8230;till the next</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the time we reached station the sun was already gone, leaving only a reddish hue on the western sky. Street lights lit up. The kids seemed ready to fall into sleep anytime soon. It would be years later when they look back into photos of this day they will realize how lucky they were. A golden weekend at one of world&#8217;s iconic place. For now they were only too happy to have collected their mementos &#8211; lapel pins with writing Mt Fuji world heritage site. Train started. a huge golden moon was rising. It was full moon night. Reclined back into the seat. In two hours the neon lights of the mega city Tokyo would push us back into our cage. Bound by time. Till then&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kyosumi Garden One Traditional Japanese Garden In Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best traditional Japanese styles garden in Tokyo is in this sleepy east part of Tokyo, Kyosumi Garden. Once it was a private garden, belonging to Mitsubishi group. In the Meiji era this was the property of Mitsubishi patriarch Kinokuniya San. From then till now &#8211; over last close to hundred and fifty years this area of Tokyo has undergone a sea change. But this one garden has been well preserved under care of Mitsubishi group. Being accessible only to company high ranking officials and their guests this garden maintained its originality, oblivious of all the rapid changes happening around.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3240.8507755459514!2d139.79561561491894!3d35.680676180194375!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6018893e17559757%3A0xf238b51ea3c37819!2sKiyosumi+Garden!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1475903959614" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was built around a central pond, with wooden bridges, tea house, undulating small hills and valleys, forests full of Japanese pines, maples,  junipers, and bamboo groves. Stone steps led to the bridge below an artificial waterfall. Water worn old stones having specific religious bearings were shipped in from distant places around Japan and positioned carefully in the landscape. The ambiance is still there.</p>
<div id="attachment_1098" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1098" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg" alt="One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it&#8217;s maintained by local government. For a minimal entry fee charged. It&#8217;s a few minutes walk from Toei Oedo line or Hanzomon line Kyosumi Shirakawa station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being somewhat away from the city center and key tourist attractions, the surroundings still bear the distant old Japan look. No Mc burgers, save for Denny&#8217;s if you plan for a lunch nearby. Neither too many Izakayas &#8211; the Japanese restaurants.. Traditional residential area. Shops still actually sell fresh veg produce in wooden baskets!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The walking route</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once inside you might like to follow the Arrow pointing towards the walking route. If you don&#8217;t though, you won&#8217;t be lost since there&#8217;s not many paths to choose from anyway. Walk towards the central pond, keep walking around anti clockwise. Go Past the walkway made of stone slabs. Step Across the bridge. Make your way over the stones underneath which the goldfish and the turtles laze around. Take the walk up the small tree-covered slope. Take your time. The view from here encompasses the entire water body surrounded by the green hills with a central tea room. The entire panorama in one frame. There are benches for the ones wishing to take the view in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1096" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1096" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg" alt="Panoramic view point" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Panoramic view point</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path goes further ahead passing around the tea room. It&#8217;s restricted access no peeking around please. The walkway divides. An adjacent garden comes into view. There is a wooden pavilion, and several wooden barbecue style tables. Good for taking a bento break. This area is sometimes used by those modern yoga healing classes.</p>
<div id="attachment_1099" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1099" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg" alt="The creek of Pines" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The creek of Pines</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walk Back</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From here visitors head back to the walking course that snakes behind the tea room and heads towards a narrow creek. Gold Fishes crowd around the creek. A few weather worn stones, with Japanese maples cedars and ferns growing around them create an image of a land far off. Pristine. Where waterfalls glisten in the morning sunshine, gurgling down the quiet valley. Curiously a stork some day found its way here, and since called this place home.</p>
<div id="attachment_1100" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1100" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg" alt="Time for a break" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Time for a break</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pathway past this point again starts going up.  Turns left once the Stone lamp stand comes into view. A lane goes straight ahead, heading towards the lily beds. Another forks left towards a green island, past a small bridge.</p>
<div id="attachment_1103" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1103 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg" alt="The bridge towards the central island" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The bridge towards the central island</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1102" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1102" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg" alt="A hazy winter morning" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A hazy winter morning</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The walk ends at a traditional ryokan style hall, glass  covered, with extended wooden patio. The grass lawn and the pebbled walkways merge back where the arrow said Start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Autumn is said to be the best time to enjoy this park. It&#8217;s amongst one of the sites to enjoy Fall colors right in Tokyo. At other times also, it does not fail to impress. A break from the civilized world for a couple of hours. Priceless.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Water Sports Wind Surfing near Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I spent another summer lazing around, one realization struck me. That I am now in my forties. No longer awaiting the future. Reached it. Things would perhaps no longer take a surprise new direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grew up dreaming to be a famous sportsman. With the usual paraphernalia of jazzy cars and glammodelz obviously following in. Then came the Internet age. The gap between me and the millions was just a startup away!</p>
<div id="attachment_1111" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1111" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007.jpg" alt="Sunset at Shonan Beach" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset at Shonan Beach</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No more. No more competition. Phelps won a few more medals. Well .. So? Let him keep those, poor fellow. Mark Zuckerberg went ahead, packing his millions. Hmm that one also got away.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mark II</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Never mind. I made up my mind. Away from the daily drudgery of coding / bug fixing. I booked a day off for wind surfing! Yep. Would float on water. Fly on sail. Like a butterfly. Was already floating on cloud nine days before the D day. Critics / critiques called it midlife crisis. Huh!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being in Japan has this incredible advantage. You can go for mountain climbing, or go for ocean sports, all within an hours distance. My surf boarding destination was Kamakura. Yuigahama beach. An hours JR line travel from Shinjuku, then 2 stations on Denen Toshi line.</p>
<div id="attachment_1120" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1120" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg" alt="Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kamakura Shonan area, the beach side neighborhood, is a close cousin of Hawaii with surfing , water scootering and all such sports enthusiasts crowding the neon lit pubs or skating down the wide palm lined bouleavverds. Fresh sea food restaurants jostle for attention along with Pizzarias and Berger joints.</p>
<p>Yuigahama, Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture 248-0014<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Called up the surfing school the day before. Weather was expected to be fine. Procedure was simple. Pay Jpy 7560/-, tax inclusive. Change into wetsuit, follow the instructor to the beach across the road.</p>
<div id="attachment_1122" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1122" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006.jpg" alt="Fishing boats by the beach" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fishing boats by the beach</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far so good. Ocean waves were washing my feet. Wait, patience, I quietly admonished myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Problems started when it was time to rig the stuff. Base joint, sail up, boom, nose, fin &#8211; words were grazing past me as I kept trying to make sense of rest of the sound bites. Curse. My Japanese Business language proficiency was no good for marine sports.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Loop:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Class over we stepped into the water. The gentle touch of splashing waves rekindled my spirit. 1-2-3 get up, position yourself in the center, feel the wind, take a step back, pull the sail up from water, gently swerve into position and. Fall down flat belly up in the water. Repeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some zillion tries I finally did it. Wind on my sails, gently floated. Up the bay. Until of course the instructor was desperately waving at me &#8211; nami, nami. Out of syllabus word- got to decode from gestures. Too late. The swelling wave, nami in Japanese, pulled me down in no time. Back to beginning of Loop!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not too bad for a first time though. Especially given the fact that my IT career has foreclosed any options for exercise etc. it&#8217;s coffee not muscles that move me. So lack of balance, or being out of breath pretty quickly was not unexpected. Hell would Zuckerberg do any better? Well, he might, given his expertise in Asian language etc. atleast he could make sense when he was asked to pull the lever or lower the boom!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever. I was happy. end of the day ticked one more achievement. And so was my</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">instructor &#8211; perhaps more for him given my lack of all skills one would have thought necessary!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A day at Yokohama Chinatown Cosmo world and Yamashita park</h2>
<div id="attachment_1079" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1079" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009.jpg" alt="Random shots China Town " width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00009-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Random shots China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the early part of last century Japan was rapidly evolving into an industrial nation. Trade, import of raw material, export of engineered goods helped the port town of Yokohama grow into a major world city. the marine routes between Yokohama to Shanghai and Peking grew busy. This was the time some Chinese traders settled down near Yokohama port. A stone&#8217;s throw away from the harbor this settlement grew with establishment of school and temples. The wars affected life here badly, but finally as peace returned, the expat center came into its own. It was officially recognized as Chukagai or in English as Chinatown.</p>
<div id="attachment_1088" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1088" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010.jpg" alt="Glimpses China Town" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00010-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Glimpses China Town</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently about 3-4000 people call this area home. Chinese crafts, bags, decor items, lanterns and memorabilia are available in plenty as are Chinese restaurants. For that authentic taste of Peking duck or dim sum you can head to any of the number of restaurants offering buffet choice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chinese New Year is celebrated with grandeur. It&#8217;s a photographer&#8217;s delight with lantern decorations lion dance etc. And If interested you can also have your fortune read by experts in Chinese astrology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closest rail stations are &#8211; Motomachi Chukagai station on MinatoMirai line, Ishikawacho station on JR line, Yamashita pier by steamer from Yokohama station.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cosmo World amusement park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The giant Ferris wheel of Cosmo world is hard to miss. It&#8217;s in an estate boasting major office and shopping complexes, right at the harbor of Yokohama. Well connected by both land and sea routes, it is a children&#8217;s world in the day. And a showpiece in the night, when the lights are switched on. You can&#8217;t go very wrong if you decide to spend a few hours with kids here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole amusement park is divided into several zones. For kids, who would rather be busy with arcade games like beating the monkey or catching the fish. For growing ones, who may choose to get into a dolphin boat or say a penguin one and float around in a small indoor-type water canal. Folks willing to dare can go ride into a paddle powered coaster that runs around the park. Offers a beautiful view.</p>

<div id="attachment_1084" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1084" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005.jpg" alt="A range of rides at Cosmo World" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A range of rides at Cosmo World</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the ones really grown up there are quite a few rides. Such as a rotating dish that also slides up and down on a half moon track. Or a carousel with a central stand that slowly stands up as the carousel picks up pace. Yeah there is enough to spend a few hours of quality time, supplemented by shopping in the Queens towers shopping complex next door.</p>
<div id="attachment_1081" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1081" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001.jpg" alt="Queens Tower Shopping mall Yokohama" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00001-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Queens Tower Shopping mall Yokohama</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for ones planning to be there but rather enjoy the atmosphere, there is the adjacent old harbor turned into a city park. Some would find it similar to bay side developments in London. There is even a faux London bridge. And also an old sailing ship named Nippon Maru moored in concrete for ever. Not sure if similar to the original one it also carried tea from India!</p>
<div id="attachment_1074" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1074" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004.jpg" alt="Nippon Maru Park" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00004-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nippon Maru Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cosmo world children&#8217;s park closes early. But you can choose to hop into the giant Ferris wheel that lights up in the evening and enjoy the bay view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to reach Cosmo world from Yokohama would be via MinatoMirai line. Get down right at the MinatoMirai station. Or if you are like us you can choose to come by steamer from Yokohama.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you try to compare Cosmo World  with other children&#8217;s amusement park like Disney it will not be a fair comparison though. So expectations may need to be managed, if visiting with kids who have already been to Disney. For us this was the case. However once the kids got onto the rides all complaints were soon forgotten. As for us adults it was an alternative lighter on pocket leaving spare for some shopping next door!  Its a win win what do ya say?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Yamashita park Yokohama bay</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s one long pasture of green, with wide walking paths cutting through hedges and flower beds. Wooden benches under olden-days style street lamps. A road on one side separating it from the sea. That&#8217;s all that is Yamashita park.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the evening lights are switched on, the Cosmo world Ferris wheel in the distance and the yellow glow of the street lamps around create a dreamy ambience. Moist sea breeze sprays mist on people walking by the seaside. Evenings in summer see many town folks coming here spending a few hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd wanes as night comes, because this harbor area is somewhat far from residential corners. It borders the business district, the office and shopping malls that have come up in place of the old warehouses. Only the Chinatown is one residential area close by, a block away. So it is not unusual for couples leaving Yamashita park heading to Chinatown for dinner. When rest of the neighborhood settles down for the night Chinatown restaurants still stay awake.</p>
<div id="attachment_1090" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1090" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006.jpg" alt="Yamashita Park Yokohama" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yamashita Park Yokohama</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one other resident of this area that perhaps stay awake is the old ship Hikawa Maru. Now Retired permanently, docked at a pier at one end of Yamashita park. It was the pride of Japan in its heydays as the ocean liner ferrying the rich and the famous across Pacific.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marine Day celebrations at Yamashita Park</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This daily routine takes a break though during the one day called Sparkling Twilight. It is the Yokohama annual summer festival day. Its a national holiday &#8211; Marine day. On this day Yamashita park fills in with crowd. A fair comes up on the grounds selling food and stuff. Live Art exhibitions are held. We saw how artists use chisel and hammer to carve a beautiful statue out of a solid block of ice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the day rolles into evening, lights come up on Hikawa Maru. Brilliantly lit Cosmo world Ferris wheel shines in the distance. Coast guard ships perform marine day parade, sailing in close to the harbor and blowing their horns as they pass by. At the preset time the horn on Hikawa Maru toots. Fireworks shoot up in a dazzling display. Night for this one day takes rest. At Yamashita Park.</p>
<div id="attachment_1085" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1085" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007.jpg" alt="Evening at Yamashita Park" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/COSMO00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Evening at Yamashita Park</p></div>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mitsubishi industrial museum Yokohama</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mitsubishi is commonly known as the GE of Japan. Been in business for more than a century. From grain trading to aircraft and ship manufacturing it has its imprints everywhere. It owns large tracts of land and real estate in Otemachi, the downtown business center of Tokyo. So it has much to show and tell to the coming generations. The 2 floor museum in Yokohama seaside is a tribute to this rich history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designed in futuristic shades of white and grey it is part of a sky-high Mitsubishi building on the museum street. Reachable easily by JR from Sakuragicho station or from metro Minaromirai line Minaromirai station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We went for a visit on Saturday this last week of August. On the way we decided to take a short detour &#8211; take a trip on steamer from Yokohama station. Got down at MinatoMirai pier. Walked two blocks to reach the museum. Tickets purchased straight in we headed towards the man in space suit. It&#8217;s actually just the space suit, with stairs behind for little ones to climb up into the space suit! An ideal photo op. The exhibits here on wards proved to be equally interesting.</p>
<div id="attachment_1064" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1064" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008-300x300.jpg" alt="The Space Suit and the central hall" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00008.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Space Suit and the central hall</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First on the right of the space suit there is a driving simulator. Suppose you want to feel how it feels to be a driver driving a subway train. A giant LCD screen displays stations passing by as you / your little co-passenger drives. Others can take a sit in behind the driver. There was a long queue though.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Ocean Exploration Hall</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next on we headed towards the ocean exploration room. It houses a giant submersible, a mock up of SHINKAI 6500 the deep sea submersible. visitors can take a peek inside the control chamber. There is even a simulation game for the little explorer to control a submersible through a deep sea passage! A piece of thick metal plated vessel kept at one comer seems to have been sheared off by some undersea monster. It actually shows how thick the walls of a submersible need to be. Else water pressure tears a vessel apart made of solid steel! There were puzzle games to be played on screen &#8211; stuff like build a submersible by dragging and dropping pieces. Neat, for our eight year old.</p>
<div id="attachment_1062" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1062 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006.jpg" alt="The ocean exploration hall" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The ocean exploration hall</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Space Exploration Hall</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next halt was the room on aircrafts. The nose cone of a Real aircraft peeked out of the room. It was a mockup of a real passenger jet! Cut into half, with the pilots cabin and a few sits behind being set up there. Young pilots can experience flying using real controls through simulator. His/her passengers can watch from behind. Seat bests must. Enough to experience a flight, on land. Beware the queue here can get really long especially on weekends.</p>
<div id="attachment_1061" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1061" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005.jpg" alt="The aircraft experience area" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The aircraft experience area</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The passage next winds through an alleyway with walls on two sides depicting space history in pictures. The passage opens into an area for rockets, showcasing exhaust pipes of rockets. Big enough to qualify as a room of a capsule hotel!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The passage then heads into an innocuous corner marked with pictures of balloons, aero planes, satellites and rockets. As one stands in the center of the corner, an overhead camera is activated. It projects images down showing pictures of Yokohama, Japan, the green and blue earth, the Arctic lights,shooting stars passing by. It gives a feeling as if one is going up, with projections showing views as seen from a balloon, a helicopter, an aeroplane, a satellite, all in their average altitudes. A strand of light blinks its way up showing the height reached at each point. A very engaging way of demonstrating how high up really is the space.</p>
<div id="attachment_1060" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1060" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004.jpg" alt="The Space History exploration area" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00004-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Space History exploration area</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stepping out of the corner we take a few steps and reach the 3D projection room. A small room of circular shape, big enough to perhaps hold 10 persons standing comfortably. not that impressive in the beginning. But as the demonstration started, things changed. Cameras projected images on the wall and the floor. Lights changed, turning the floor pitch black with a few stars here and there. From floor to the wall it was a continuous 3-dimensional screen, with we spectators standing somewhere in this expanse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon we were standing at the edge of the earth. An alien space craft appeared in the horizon. It came closer. The spacecraft came closer and closer, doors opened, stairs extended, slowly reached our level. In no time we were at the bridge. I was ready in my mind, Light Sabres activated. Did I just hear foot steps, sound of heavy breathe? The show ended. In a word it was captivating &#8211; especially if you do not know what to expect off it.  Sorry, am such a spoiler.</p>
<div id="attachment_1065" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003.jpg" alt="Intergalatic journey" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Intergalatic journey</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2nd Floor Energy Information Gallery</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next upstairs the gallery opened into wide open space without any separation wall. Zones were marked for specific exhibits. Our first target here was the Skywalk adventure, a part of the Trial Square section. Here one can experience piloting a helicopter with real simulator. However space being limited one needs to be fairly early to reserve slot. We were late.  As an alternative there was other lab activities. But we gave it a pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The huge floor to ceiling projections in the center of the gallery was showing images of our earth and environment. If alone one could take a seat and enjoy the visuals. But we were traveling with kids. So well we moved on. To a next activity showing how energy is generated from natural resources like coal, petroleum, nuclear energy, solar energy etc. Nice show, but did not lend itself to much activity. There was a scale model of a thermal energy plant, with minute details. Then there were chunks of coal, half a canister of black petrol, and a piece of mineral stone apparently containing uranium.</p>
<div id="attachment_1067" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1067" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007.jpg" alt="Energy and transportation section" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00007-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Energy and transportation section</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Credit must be given to the museum for its effort to make things interesting for all ages. Here also there was a button to press, to see how radioactive minerals glow! Then there was a big screen for kids to solve a puzzle and in the process learn how steam turns a turbine and generate electricity. There was also a game where you could control a man flying through a factory, with hopefully, learning something about the various components in a real power plant. Somewhat ambitious, but one would not complaint as it made a fair attempt at getting kids engaged and understand those things.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2nd Floor Transportation Research section</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other half of the gallery had a collection of miniature rail engines, ships, airplanes within glass showcases. The famous zero fighters and the aircraft carrier Musashi stood next to passenger plane models and military aircrafts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A part of the hall wedged between the energy gallery and the models section has been converted into a mini library. Around the library there are some exhibits that explain more fundamentals of science. Of course through interactive activities. Turn the driving wheel, see how the wheels of a car turn left or right. Matter of levers and gears and camshafts. Each of these things are further explained through separate exhibits. Lift a 10 kg weight, feels heavy especially to young hands. Engage levers, engage pulleys, and see how one can lift the same weight easily now.</p>
<div id="attachment_1058" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1058" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002.jpg" alt="Gears pulleys levers and more reading" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITSU00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gears pulleys levers and more reading</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s really difficult to explain science to kid, leave alone make him enjoy and wish to come back. Mitsubishi has done a good job. However the purpose of the museum is not just to educate kids on science but also to make people aware how Mitsubishi has been at the forefront of technology and industry. So the history part does exist, and overall arrangement was constrained to areas where Mitsubishi operates. These constraints may pit it unfavorably if compared against the similar but more engaging to children science exhibitions built by Sony or Panasonic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of these had the liberty of using audio visual attractions, in line with their businesses. But Mitsubishi is in core engineering area. So it gets full credits for how it weaved core engineering with its history into a museum.</p>
