<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nijo castle was the residence of the Shogun in Kyoto, T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his was the place that united the land once divided into numerous fiefdoms into one country that is Nihon -Japan. </span></p>
<h3>The Singing Nightingale</h3>
<p>Japan was formally ruled by the emperor but power was concentrated in the hands of his .military general -the Shogun. Shogun set up his own administrative center in Nijo castle. Its where the he held his court. No wonder it was built to be secure as a fort with measures that included a surrounding moat and an outer and an inner perimeter fence. But the most unique feature of this castle was the state of the art defensive measure -the &#8220;singing platform&#8221;. Any potential assassin trying to tip-toe in would be detected as soon as he stepped on the floor as the floor would &#8220;sing&#8221;. This was a unique mechanism as ingenious in its engineering as scary in its message about the days political struggles.</p>

<h3>Emperor, Shogun and the Ninjas</h3>
<p>Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu was the first Shogun to have established himself as the supreme power in Japan. It was a time Japan was going through intense power struggle. Warlords fought for regional suzerainty. Hired assassins -the famed  Ninja&#8217;s &#8211; appeared in Japan&#8217;s history.  Known for their training in stealthy war craft Ninja&#8217;s were the greatest threat to Samurai lords. Nijo castle was built at this time, with this specific threat in mind. Inside the moat beyond the two perimeter walls, the inner quarters were built to alert the guards even if someone tried to tip toe on the floor. Erected from two separate layers with a series of metal spikes hanging in between , the floor would clank even under the gentlest push. This was the famous singing floor, a feat of engineering that survived through the ravages of time.</p>

<h3>The Nijo Mae</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The station next to Nijo castle is called Nijo Mae. &#8220;Mae&#8221; in Japanese means &#8220;in front&#8221;. So the easiest way to reach Nijo castle was to head to Nijo Mae station. Easy peasy, we thought. Unfortunately there are multiple surface,regional and subway lines leaving from Kyoto main railway station. Directions boards are there, but scant in number as compared to the number of lines and tourists. Moreover the entrance to the subway is a shoppers paradise. So if not careful one can get lost,like we did. Nijo showed up ts defenses even before we could approach!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In underground Google maps stopped working.. Shuffling through guidebooks, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fumbling for the right word, taking to dumb charades &#8211; did all that to finally find our way to Nijo Mae.</span></p>
<h3>Students with Notebooks</h3>
<div id="attachment_1326" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1326" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-300x300.jpg" alt="Way to the Tea Room" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to the Tea Room</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approached Nijo a further surprise awaited us. It was a school day. There were a bunch of kids in yellow caps at the crossing. As soon as the signal turned green a cockle of excited voices accompanied us to the entrance of the castle. A school excursion &#8211; explained one of the more curious kid eager to practise his English. It was to be the first of a series of interactions that day with the otherwise reticent bunch of Japanese schoolkids. It soon transpired that the kids were tasked to record visitor remarks also in their worksheets. In English. And this entire exercise was meant to make them less shy and more confident in dealing with foreigners! Japan was getting ready for Olympic 2020.  </span></p>
<h3>Castle Quarters and the Courtyards</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The castle entrance was via a bridge over a moat that surrounded the high walls. The gigantic doors opened into a wide lobby, guarded by towers. Attackers even if crossed the moat and made a successful entry would be pinned in this place by sharp shooters . Another layer of wall at its end secured the inner quarters. This is where the shogun set up his council.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1333" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1333 size-large" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Intricate carvings on wood and gold leaf" width="660" height="660" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Intricate carvings on wood and gold leaf</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors from afar, the local land lords, the lower generals, the informers, the agents each had their separate visitor room inside the elaborately decorated wooden palace. Each room had its designated seating areas with the lord being seated guarded by body guards. The rooms were exquisitely decorated. There were real gold embossed paintings of cranes in lily pond or flying high amongst the clouds. The entire building comprising of visitor rooms private rooms store rooms was constructed in a rectangular fashion, with a central courtyard opening into a lily pond. </span></p>
<h3>Palace Gardens</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the functional purpose of administrative head office, Nijo castle was also a show piece, a platform to demonstrate aristocratic finesse that only the shogun could summon. A court yard from behind the living quarters opened in to Japanese garden, with its flowing stream, and stone bridges. Walkways lined by maples and cedars meandered around the castle, During autumn, fall colors painted the area in red and yellow. A tea room at a corner at the far end, under the shadow of old cedar trees, offered a feel of peace and tranquility. Couples in Kimono walked by. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stepped path from here went up towards a terrace. The entire greater Kyoto with its blue tinged mountain ranges came into view from there.</span></p>
<h3>The Quintessential Japanese</h3>
<div id="attachment_1331" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1331 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-300x300.jpg" alt="The stone bridge over to the Japanese garden" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The stone bridge over to the Japanese garden</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1332" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1332" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-300x300.jpg" alt="Maples in garden" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Maples in garden</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This embrace of nature, this surrender to  the ephemeral and eternal contrasts sharply with the identity of Nijo, as the war lords lair. This combination of power and renunciation is what defined the Shogun era Japanese psyche. Its the one common thread that runs through the defensive fabrication of the fortress, to the intricate gold leaf drawings on palace walls,  And this contrast captured in its highest form in Nijo distinguishes it as a World Heritage Site. Yes its a must visit site.     </span></p>

<h2>Fushimi Inari</h2>
<ul>
<li>15 minutes by JR NARA line from Kyoto</li>
<li>Shrine of Hollywood fame</li>
<li>Series of red Torii or wooden gates are its main attraction</li>

<p>From Tofukuji the next station is Fushimi Inari. We started from Kyoto station. Stopped at Tofukuji. Got back into the next available train in the same direction for the next stop at Fushimi. Could we have walked ? Cycled perhaps. But the journey in the small toy train like train itself was also fun.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you cross the road, a wide paved path leads the way through huge red wooden gate. This red vermilion colored Torii is what distinguishes the Fushimi Inari from others around. FushimiInari is known for Torii. It is not just for this one but  for the hundreds that follow. The path leads to the pavilion of the main temple complex. Then moves uphill.</p>

<p>It was originally an obeisance to the foxes that protected the harvest from small pests. But faith outgrew its genesis transforming into a tradition serving a larger purpose. The legend of Fushimi Inari was born.</p>

<h2>The Shrine of Hollywood Fame</h2>
<p>Unlike Tofukuji Fushimi Inari is a busier stop. Tofukuji retains quaint Japanese temple town characters. But Fushimi Inari is a tourist magnet, well known as the location  for Hollywood movie Memoirs of a Geisha. The station as a result enjoys better documentation in English.</p>
<p>Inari temples however abound in Japan, even in Tokyo. <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/fox-god-inari-and-the-environment/">https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/fox-god-inari-and-the-environment/</a></p>
<p>So does Toriies in many Shinto shrines. Its of course the most famous Inari temple made famous by its association with Hollywood. Not otherwise nearly as pretty as compared to the richly decored Kinkakuji or blessed with fall colours such as Tofukuji. So unless trying to tick a destination off your list there is a chance one may feel underwhelmed! Beauty after all lies in the eyes of the beholder&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Visiting heritage city of Kamakura in a Day Trip from Tokyo</h2>
<p>Just an hour away from Tokyo, Kamakura is an ancient heritage town. With a sea beach and an island thrown into the mix, it has something for everyone. So for our first day trip out of Tokyo we headed to this Heritage city Kamakura to cover what maximum we could in one Day Trip from Tokyo.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d415872.57377228315!2d139.36502604325494!3d35.479432916528815!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6018459b80ac5619%3A0x5700747a399f2502!2sKamakura%2C+Kanagawa+Prefecture!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sjp!4v1491427532970" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The original city of Kamakura was established as a fortress town, naturally guarded on three sides by hills, approachable only from sea. Over time this town grew in importance as the top religious and social center on the east coast of Japan, second in influence only to capital Kyoto.</p>
<p>Now Kamakura is one of the busiest tourist town. As one gets down at Kamakura station, the station decor and the adjacent  spacious tourist office indicates the importance of this place as a tourist center. There are several tour circuits covering a cross section of the Buddhist and Shinto shrines. It is quite impossible to visit all the popular shrines in a day,or even in two days. So we decided to pick two routes covering the most famous of Kamakura shrines, with a quick hop to Enoshima island, if time allowed. We took the Odakyu line with Kamakura Enoden free pass.</p>

<h3>Leg 1: Dai Butsu and Hase Dera</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First on our list was Dai Butsu and Hase Dera temple. Dai Butsu, the Big Buddha, is iconic of Kamakura. And Hase Dera traces its origin back to seventh century arrival of Buddhism to Japan. This back ground, coupled with the fact that there is a direct connect to Hase by the narrow gauge Enoden line helped us choose this as our 1st destination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enoden line  has its own charm. Its is a small train that goes snaking behind terraces and kitchens, sometimes like a tram right in the middle of road, sometimes right by the sea side. Its an experience on its own. Especially for children. </span></p>
<h4>Dai Butsu- The Big Buddha</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">   Getting down at Hase station, we crossed the rail line heading towards Daibutsu. The narrow road divides at a point where the left lane goes to the great Hase Dera temple. We headed straight. First target was Dai Butsu. Traditional art and crafts shops crowd into the pavement. Shortly the entrance way shrouded in bamboo groves and maple and cedar trees appear in front. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1243" style="width: 268px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1243" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012-258x300.jpg" alt="Kamakura Dai Butsu" width="258" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012-258x300.jpg 258w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012-300x349.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00012.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kamakura Dai Butsu</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We queue for tickets. Ticket jackets describe the story of Daibutsu &#8211; the great Buddha. Its a gigantic bronze statue that survived many a tsunamis and earthquakes. Now it is surrounded by manicured Japanese garden, with shaded rest areas. As one walks through the garden past the ancient cedars, the Buddha in meditative pose comes fully into view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walk further close, up the stairs, past the incense stick stand. The Buddha had his hands folded into a mudra, eyes closed deep into introspection. There are shades  with wooded benches on all three sides. Sitting there were devotees with rosaries in hand, serious photographers, curious tourists. We walk around. Step into the garden. Garden of cedars and junipers. Shaded, calm and quiet. There was a hillock close by, with a small wooden temple at its foot. On a side there is a souvenir shop. Visitors bought incense sticks to offer with prayer.  Pretentious human existence suddenly appeared so small.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was this tunnel beneath the Daibutsu statue. It led inside the statue. A few narrow dark steps ends at a small platform. There was nothing much to see. Just satiated curiosity. We stepped out and sat down on the wooden benches under the shade. Let go of the tiredness. Started early in the day, packing, rushing, huffing and puffing boarding the train at Shinjuku station. Then squeezing into the Enoden train. Finally following the crowd to Dai Butsu. At last we are there. Read about it, always wanted to see. </span></p>
<h4>Hase Dera</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From Daibutsu we headed back walking towards the junction where the road forked. This time took the one heading to Hase Dera. This road was narrow, claimed both by pedestrians and cars and tourist buses. So had to stop and go. There were craft shops, antique shops and restaurants all jostling for attention on the two sides. The ambiance changes once you walk up to the gate of Hase Dera.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1259" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1259" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028-227x300.jpg" alt="Hase Dera Entrance" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028-300x396.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00028.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hase Dera Entrance</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1261" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1261" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00030-300x227.jpg" alt="Stepping inside Hase Dera " width="300" height="227" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00030-300x227.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00030.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Stepping inside Hase Dera</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tera or Dera means (Buddhist) temple. Legend has it that in the eighth century a monk dreamt of a log floating in by the sea. He actually found that log in the morning and enshrined it as god. Over time its fame spread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right inside past the entry gate, a Japanese garden, with a stream and a lily pond, welcomes you. Through the floating leaves colored fishes swim by. A bridge crosses the stream to the base of a stone stair. The steps lead to landing, with a small temple, then goes further up to the main temple complex at the hill top.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1258" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1258" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00027-300x227.jpg" alt="Traditional Japanese garden in Hase Dera" width="300" height="227" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00027-300x227.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00027.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Traditional Japanese garden in Hase Dera</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1257" style="width: 292px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1257 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026-282x300.jpg" alt="Colored fishes swimming in Hase Dera stream" width="282" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026-282x300.jpg 282w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026-300x319.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00026.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Colored fishes swimming in Hase Dera stream</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temple was originally by the shore, but over time residences cropped up all around. The view from the top though is still beautiful. The entire shore comes into view,  with fishing boats here and there and few hazy outlines of ships in the distance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1271" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1271" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200005.jpg" alt="Buddha in meditation -statue in garden" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200005.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200005-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Buddha in meditation -statue in garden</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1269" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1269" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200003-300x227.jpg" alt="Temple with a prayer wheel " width="300" height="227" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200003-300x227.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA200003.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Temple with a prayer wheel</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A giant prayer wheel is there in an adjacent hall, with its own Japanese garden, lily pond, little bridge and stone paved path. For the curious, and untired, there are some more but smaller temples a little walk away towards the rear boundary. And there is a cave too, walk-able up to a distance.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1240" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1240" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009-227x300.jpg" alt="Goldleaf Buddha in Hase Dera" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009-300x396.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00009.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Goldleaf Buddha in Hase Dera</p></div>
<p>We explored around for sometime. The sun got stronger. In summer the sandy sea side heats up quickly. We step inside the main temple hall. It was dark, torched partially by the hundreds of candles lit. The golden Buddha is silent deep in meditation. Occasional drum beats, gong of the temple bell, flickering candle light, all helped bring up an imagery of a thousand years gone by. You don&#8217;t need to be a believer. The ambiance sweeps you in.</p>
<h3>Leg 2: Hachimangu and Hokokuji</h3>
<p>From Hase station we head back to Kamakura. The road out of the rail station crosses the city bus stop. This time our destination is Hachimangu, Its walkable from station. So we cross the bus stop. And merge into the central arterial road of Kamakura. This road has been there for some thousand years at least. Emerging from the sea shore it heads straight on to the stairs of Hachimangu, dissecting the city into East and West. The city life revolved around this temple.</p>
<h4>Tsurugaouka Hachimangu Shrine</h4>
<p>Hachimangu was the cultural and social epicenter. The stairs of Hachimangu have seen major power struggle and blood letting. The East and West sides had traditionally been strongholds of two opposing Samurai clans. Stories of their valor and struggle made these portals of Hachimangu part of Japanese lore. There are lily ponds on the two sides of Hachimangu, named after the two clans.</p>
<div id="attachment_1236" style="width: 582px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1236" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00004.jpg" alt="Hachimangu Temple" width="572" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00004.jpg 572w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00004-300x263.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hachimangu Temple</p></div>
<p>None of the old are there any more, but it&#8217;s history as the power center and the family temple of Shogun has bestowed an unmistakable aura to Hachimangu. The city of today still centers around it.</p>
<p>But in last few centuries there have been major events that shook Japan. Meiji revolution, world war. Fall of the shoguns, rise of the emperor, Japans rise as colonial power, followed by eventual fall. Somewhere through this the once glorious Kamakura lost out. So did Hachimangu. The huge complex that was there once upon a time is barely discernible now.</p>
<div id="attachment_1239" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1239" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00007-300x242.jpg" alt="Rickshaws for tourists Kamakura" width="300" height="242" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00007-300x242.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00007.jpg 622w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rickshaws for tourists Kamakura</p></div>
<p>Tourists have replaced the devotees. Flashy souvenir shops, upscale restaurants and travel operator signboards adorn the two sides of the road to Hachimangu. The main thoroughfare takes a boulevard appearance as it heads out from the station. Tradition is still valued, and followed, but packaged in a very modern getup. Rickshaws still ply, only if as tourist attraction.</p>
<div id="attachment_1237" style="width: 246px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1237" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005-236x300.jpg" alt="Lily ponds of Hachimangu" width="236" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005-236x300.jpg 236w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005-300x382.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00005.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lily ponds of Hachimangu</p></div>
<p>In about ten minutes we reach the shrine entrance. Vermilion colored Tori gates. Old stone bridge. The main temple visible at a distance ahead. We make our way through the crowd. Foreign tourists, locals, busy taking selfies. Occasional claps follow a reverential bow.</p>
<p>Some festival was going on the day we went. There were a few shops selling traditional gyoza (dumplings) on the two sides. From the main approach road a street forks out to the right. Priests quarters. A red bridge on the left leads to a lily pond. We headed straight towards the stairs.</p>

<p>From a distance we could hear traditional musical instrument playing. A marriage ceremony was being held. Social ceremonies are held in the ceremony hall at the base of the stairs, facing the temple entrance. Tourists with cameras were recording the proceedings. Bride, groom and their guests in bridal best were seated on the two sides. The head priest in the middle was chanting shlokas. Offerings of fruits and sweets were kept on a table facing the temple pulpit.</p>
<div id="attachment_1256" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1256" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025.jpg" alt="The old bridge of Hachimangu" width="502" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025.jpg 502w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00025-300x299.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The old bridge of Hachimangu</p></div>
<p>We stopped for a while, then took the stairs up. Stepped past the Tori gate into the inner sanctorum. A ceremonial function was being held in an adjacent hall. It was certainly some auspicious day. Police were controlling the crowd. Most of the heavy wooden doors around leading to the inner halls were closed to ordinary visitors. An open side pavilion stood there, with a display of richly decorated mikoshis, kept ready for special occasions.</p>
<div id="attachment_1248" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1248" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017.jpg" alt="Offerings and prayer -Hachimangu" width="501" height="661" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00017-300x396.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Offerings and prayer -Hachimangu</p></div>
<p>We stepped out. Into the open space at the top of the stairs. A wide angle view of the entire complex is available from this point. Perhaps hundreds of years ago here the Shoguns stood, addressing followers from this very step!</p>
<p>We take a side walk on the way down. The marriage ceremony was over by then. Guests in their ceremonial dresses were still sticking around taking a few more snaps. Wandering further to the left we reach a tree-shaded area, covered with Japanese maples, cedars, and bamboo groves. A small rivulet, with a wooden bridge, comes into view. We were short of time otherwise would have loved to spend some more time there.</p>
<p>We moved on crossing the bridge, not quite sure going where but carried on to see what follows. The passage wound its way out into an opening that ended at a lily pond. One of the two belonging to the warrior clans. Colored fishes here were comfortable with tourists, eagerly posing in front. Almost jostling for the best location. Same goes for the flocks of pigeons that flew down from somewhere. None afraid of human presence. Rather expected to be fed, petted, photographed. A practice perhaps for over a thousand years.</p>
<h4>Hokokuji</h4>
<p>Next on our list was Hokokuji. Famous for its tea house housed in a bamboo grove. The tea house is at the end of a cobbled stone walkway that winds behind the main temple. It passes by a zen garden. Passes by an area where from you can see old caves on the hill side. Now prohibited, separated by wire mesh, but perhaps a thousand or so years ago these caves were humble dwellings for the temple hermits. This temple traces its history to the time the original settlers established the town of Kamakura. It was extended and taken care of by later era Shogun clans who converted it into their family temple.</p>

<div id="attachment_1249" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1249" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018-227x300.jpg" alt="Neighborhood entrance at Hokokuji" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018-227x300.jpg 227w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018-300x396.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00018.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Neighborhood entrance at Hokokuji</p></div>
<p>Unlike Hachimangu, Hokokuji is somewhat off the tourist center of Kamakura, being reachable only by bus. But rather than being a disadvantage, that has perhaps helped preserve its originality. The walkway to the temple is through a rustic neighborhood. Seems to be just waking up from its village past. The path way to the temple is rather narrow. Traffic sergeants at the two ends warn tourists when a car approaches. Moss and fern covers some portion of walls of the neighborhood houses. Hasty patches of cement work covers others that gave way under age.</p>
<p>But once inside the temple gates, one forgets all that was left outside. Velvet green moss covered garden, with a Buddha, beckons. Japanese maple branches curl up around stone boulders. Spring water dribbles down a water fountain. Wooden ladles kept to wash oneself before entering the inner precincts..</p>

<p>Past the ticket gate, the Zen rock garden comes into view. The walk way bends here and there. Goes past stone statuettes, covered in green moss. At one point one can see the caves on the hill side. The walkway makes its serpentine way further ahead. Now through a bamboo grove. Ends at a tea house. This is Hokokuji.</p>
<p>We spend some time here. Allowing our imaginations a free run through time. Who were the folks who came for prayers here, over the past hundreds of years? Celebrating their life events &#8211; birth of a child, marriage, death. Generation after generation. Would somebody from amongst my descendants also come visit this place one day? Would he or she realize that I was here, and imagined about him/her coming back to this place?</p>

<p>Hunger breaks the stupor. It was already well past our usual lunch hour. We rush back,to grab a quick grub.</p>
<h3>Leg 3: Enoshima</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post lunch, we again board the Enoden train, this time getting down at Enoshima station. Our day pass is used to its maximum. As we walked down towards the beach, the roadside characteristics gradually change. From the heritage temple town to hip and happening US West. Most houses looked like they were lifted straight out off some American soap &#8211; the red bricks, the curved railing etc. Even the trees were no longer maple or juniper but palms &#8211; beach side palms! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main road running by the beach was wide. Seafront apartments with balconies could easily give one the impression of being in California, Florida or Hawaii. Orange hued stone walled restaurants greet tourists with &#8220;Aloha&#8221; in neon. Surfing boards dry on the sand. Beach side shacks play music, dish out seafood with beer. Young guys and gals on skate boards zoom past. </span></p>
<p>Checked the time. It was 3 o clock in the afternoon. Just in time for the last ticket sale for the <span style="font-weight: 400;">dolphin show in the sea life park &#8211; the enoshima aquarium. Famed for its Dolphin show, but its collection of sea anemones, jelly fishes, sting rays and sharks are also varied. For kids there&#8217;s a touch and feel section, to experience how it feels to touch a sea cucumber or a star fish! There is also a deep water submersible that was once used by Japan for ocean research. Outside the halls, in the open deck overlooking the ocean shore, there are telescopes to view ships anchored in the distance. Certainly the aquarium merited a whole day on its own but we were short of time. So sped through from hall to hall, to finally flop down for the dolphin show.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.enosui.com/en/" target="_blank">Enoshima Aquarium website</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the show ended, evening was setting in. Evening glow reflected in the sea. Restaurant lights came up. We walked along the beach. Reached the bridge that connects main land with Enoshima island. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1246" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1246" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015.jpg" alt="Evening glow on the Kamakura beach" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KAMAKURA00015-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Evening glow on the Kamakura beach</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Surf boarders, sail boarders were heading home after the day&#8217;s play. We crossed the bridge. Reached the point where from a road goes up an incline to the temple at the island top.  The two sides of the street are lined with souvenir shops. And eateries. Fresh grilled food. Ice cream. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The usually colorful Japanese fan and handbag shops look more colorful in the evening light.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1120" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1120" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg" alt="Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SURFIN00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kamakura Shonan A.K.A Hawaii</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further into the island there were caves one could visit. But it was already late evening and the chill in the air set in. Sea gulls were hovering above for the last bits before retiring for the night. It was a long day. We were tired. But it was a memorable day well worth a second visit. In a little while we were speeding down in super express train zooming past the suburban stations. Half asleep half deep in thought as we headed back home to Tokyo. Hectic, but memorable one day trip to Kamakura.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A weekend family trip to Mt Fuji Lake Kawaguchiko Lake Saiko Asama Shrine Wind Cave and Yoshino Sato</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather this year has been rather unusual. No summer, just rain. Apparently the second wettest season in recorded history of Japan. The wettest was the year 1961 when heavy typhoon triggered massive landslides destroying what was known as the most beautiful village of Japan. It was beside lake Saiko facing Mt Fuji. We will talk more about it later here. The route to lake Saiko starts from the hilly rail station of Lake Kawaguchiko. Asama shrine is within a short distance of Kawaguchiko station.  Wind cave falls on the way to Yoshino Sato village. These are the top 5 sites you must visit if going on a weekend trip to Fuji 5 lakes area. And got a family with kids. And looking for a refreshing break not a hurried rush.  That is how this awesome 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji five lakes area happened. Let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<div id="attachment_1168" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1168 size-full" title="Recommended 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji 5 Lakes area" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights.jpg" alt="Recommended 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji 5 Lakes area" width="391" height="155" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights.jpg 391w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights-300x119.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/five-Lakes-5-sights-390x155.jpg 390w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Recommended 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji five lakes area</p></div>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A bit of Intro</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fuji five lakes formed several thousand years ago, due to a volcanic eruption. Rivers blocked turned into lakes. Dense forest now covers most of the peaks around, except Mt.Fuji which is currently dormant but have a hot underlayer spewing sulphuric vapors through the porous upper layer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without any green cover, having uniform gradient on all sides, Mt Fuji looks more like an engineered structure , rather than a natural formation. The 3776 M high peak rises gradually up all the way from near sea level. Visible from as far as Tokyo this imposing giant has been revered across Japan as the seat of the heavens. A sight to cherish a place to honor. The five lakes around it formed a beautiful surrounding. On clear days the reflection of the peak on the waters of Lake Kawaguichiko, the largest of the five lakes, inspire tired souls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Journey Starts &#8211; 2 day trip top 5 sights in Fuji five lakes</h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbxZk7YMtVA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time we were to stay at a lakeside cottage by the lake Kawaguchiko. And decided to take local bus trips to places around. Itinerary included this village Yoshin Sato known as Japan&#8217;s most beautiful village. And also the lava caves formed thousands of years ago around lake Saiko. If one is visiting Japan for a month or more then visiting Mt Fuji is a natural thing. Booking a two story cottage having a clear view of Mt Fuji from the onsen or the garden &#8211; it just happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the unusually heavy rain all through the summer months worried us. The weather seemed ready to spoil all plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">just the day before departure the sky cleared. Prediction for the weekend was sunny! When we reached hotel our host greeted us saying this would be only the 5th or 6th times in the entire previous two months when Mt Fuji was expected to be visible! And man how awesome that can be. We were to discover soon.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">By train or bus &#8211; 2 hours</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Shinjuku all highway buses were full. Thanks to satellite weather monitoring the entire Tokyo knew this was The weekend to go visit Mt Fuji and its five lakes. Car rental was also out of question. The only other but costlier option was to buy train tickets. By the way when someone says costly in Japan you better mind it. Some stuff otherwise normal outside can cost an arm and a leg in Japan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be that as it may, journey by train meant it was more spacious. When you have kids you know what a difference to your travel experience it can make.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are we there yet? Well ah &#8230;look there&#8217;s that nice car you see we are going faster than that … Can&#8217;t you see? A chocolate ? No, candy? She has got the larger one…</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Train we boarded was direct to Kawaguchiko. Within Two hours we were at destination. Recharged selves with fresh hot bowls of udon and curry rice. Luggage at station locker, we boarded the local Red line bus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First point of interest was Kachi Kachi Ropeway. Walkable from station. But we are couch flyers, walking is too much work. Unfortunately, the bus encountered a group of tourists from some other Far East Asian country. All 11 of them. the bus could accommodate barely 2 more. Negotiation started &#8211; 2 more not 8 more? Are you sure? Ah what did you say &#8211; Yes? Home country norms understandably dictated the outcome. Did you ever feel jealous of canned sardines before ?</p>
<div id="attachment_1145" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1145 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004.jpg" alt="The Kawaguchiko Cruise" width="381" height="741" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004-154x300.jpg 154w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00004-300x583.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Kawaguchiko Cruise</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kachi Kachi was a nice change. The sun was already turning orange. Fuji in the silhouette, it&#8217;s entire form as if a gentle giant rising from earth. Customary photo done we headed for the steamer station below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The 2nd &#8211; Lake Kawaguchiko cruise</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hill regions tend to draw into darkness sooner. The long shadows of the peaks around Fuji fell on lake Kawaguchiko. In between the water sparkled, colored in Orange Afternoon glow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Viewing the surroundings from the open deck of the steamer, one could see the huge Mt Fuji standing tall amongst the blue-grey mountain ranges in the horizon. Few tourists were rowing the small boats. Cranes flying back. Evening was about to set in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Headed back to Kawaguchiko station. Collected luggage, waited for the pick up van from hotel. Ours was a serviced cottage. We picked up groceries from Ogino, the local supermarket. The warm wood paneled two storied cottage with heated floor felt so welcoming! A quick trip to the covered in-premise onsen, and we were in dreamland.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>
<p><span id="more-1140"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Day 2 a clear morning</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QA1w_3fm36k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next morning was bright. Headed towards the lake, a 3 minutes walk. Autumn Sun rays were gently brushing the lake. A layer of Mist still covered the lake surface. One or two fishermen already were out with their boats. Fuji was yet not visible. Drew in deep breathes. Such freshness.</p>
<div id="attachment_1164" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1164" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006.jpg" alt="Dawn breaking on Mt Fuji" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00006-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dawn breaking on Mt Fuji</p></div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sight #3 &#8211; The magnificent Asama Shrine</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After breakfast checked out. Kept the luggage with the hotel. Walked towards Asama shrine. Said to be twelve hundred years old it is remarkable due to the giant cedars in its premises. An ambiance of peace and quietude reigned. Sound of a nearby waterfall was the only sound that could be heard. Apart from our own footsteps. Barely any visitor. The vermilion colored huge entrance gate -the Torii -seemed standing there lost in its own.</p>
<div id="attachment_1160" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1160" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008.jpg" alt="Asama Shrine and the 1200 year old cedars" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00008-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Asama Shrine and the 1200 year old cedars</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shrine was hidden amongst the tall pines and the cedars. Cedars were planted in formation mimicking the Big Dipper constellation. Why ? Nobody has an answer. The cedars themselves &#8211; Giant, aged, experienced, but alas, silent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An old person came out from a nearby shop. Curious he asked us where we are from what are we for in Japan etc. Then slid into a monologue about how great this shrine once was &#8211; it&#8217;s history, tradition. With childish Enthusiasm he went ahead up to the shrine porch, pushed a door ajar. A ginormous paper lantern hung. Door shut, another door opened. A mikoshi, richly decorated, colors somewhat paled, came into view. It&#8217;s a wooden shrine carried on shoulders by devotees around neighborhood, He explained many things. But unfortunately our limited vocabulary, and time, drew the conversation to closure. Wish we planned better!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were dropped back to Kawaguchiko station courtesy hotel pickup and drop off service. This time another two tourists were in the van. sounded French to us, if not Greek. We were to get into Greenline bus today. Redlines travel locally around Kawaguchiko. Green lines cover a larger tourist circle, including lake Saiko.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Next leg by Green line &#8211; all the way to Lake Saiko</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In such trips normally we take care to mark a nearby Combini &#8211; Japan&#8217;s ubiquitous neighborhood convenient stores selling everything. For us combinis have stood there in all times good or bad. In the beginning When what&#8217;s your name was too difficult a question to comprehend. And then now and then providing us with hot meals when we are too tired. Or just lazy.. Cakes/pasta/curry rice/ cup noodles &#8211; good enough. Though certainly not good enough for you planning to relish a leisurely meal. A proper restaurant served meal. Kawaguchiko station area for that matter is not the best place anyway. We picked up our grub from the Combini right outside. Stood in queue for Greenline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one ticket for redline also works for Greenline. Both economical and convenient. Didn&#8217;t have to wait long. Soon we were out into the less touristy more natural surroundings of the greater Kawaguchiko area. Cottages by the lakeside, fishing boats, and blue lake reflecting images of green peaks. forest still dense in certain areas, roots covered by algae fed by fresh rain, part of the Aokigahara forest land.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Destination # 4 &#8211; Wind Cave</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our first destination in this leg of the trip was wind cave. A lava cave formed after the bubbles in the cooling lava burst. Said to be of lower gradient, safe for kids and senior citizens. Part of the cave complex that opens at other end known as ice cave. Hidden in forest under ground, these caves stay cold through the out the year. Icy stalactites form inside the Ice cave in winter. The locals used to store grains and silk cocoons. Introduction of Commercial refrigerators led to gradual disuse. But now the tourism authority has taken over. tourists visit in droves. Electrical Lights, stairs, a more or less paved passageway helps navigate inside. Grains and silk cocoons are still kept inside, only for demonstration though.</p>
<div id="attachment_1165" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1165" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009.jpg" alt="Wind cave near Lake Saiko" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00009-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wind cave near Lake Saiko</p></div>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">A bit about the bus stop &#8211; sorry solved the puzzle!</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greenline bus reaches wind cave passing by the bat cave and the beautiful village known as Yoshino no Sato.Greenlines makes a loop around Yoshino Sato, right before visiting the wind cave and again right after.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Somewhat like USA??!</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From bus stop we crossed the road and walked a short distance to the ticket gate. The entire area is covered in green forest. Save for the grass covered parking area outside the forest entrance. Kept reminding me of our trip to the Kentucky caves, USA. Only this area perhaps receives much more rain. So the tree roots are covered in moss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wind cave indeed was as exciting as we expected. Not too difficult. entry was two flights of stairs down. Usually Rain drenched, needed careful steps. challenge was the low ceiling. Lights did show warnings at critical places. The navigable path inside was just about fifty feet or so. Thereafter it narrowed further making it difficult for normal tourists. Spelunking enthusiasts may continue though, perhaps emerging out at the ice cave end. Ice cave can also be reached by a well marked path from a point near the ticket gate. Other option in case you are interested is to take a bus to the next stop around the forest. We didn&#8217;t. not this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Headed back to the same Redline bus stop where we got down across the road. Today&#8217;s next destination &#8211; Yoshino Sato.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Experience #5 &#8211; Yoshino Sato</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bus dropped us at a stop next to a narrow river. It&#8217;s a wide plain valley, surrounded by peaks. The river runs a short distance before meeting lake Saiko. Color of water in lake Saiko is green, the color of the forest covered hill ranges. Yoshino Sato village is a little walk up. Down here in the valley there is a small market next to the bus stop. It caters to the villagers and tourists alike. Roasted corns, grilled fish on a stick, fresh farm produce. touristy brick a brack. Asked the owner of the shop selling polished chips of colored stones as jewelry &#8211; are these sourced locally? A sheepish smile was the only answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way to village went up by the side of the stream. It is October. white blooms of kans grass (saccharum spontaneum) filled the two sides. Ripe pumpkins in the vegetable patches reminded Halloween was approaching. The sky appeared extra blue.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">It is all about the experience&#8230;</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoshino Sato is described as the most beautiful village in Japan. It is a collection of thatched roof cottages. With gardens, stream, small bridges, and narrow winding pathways. Mt Fuji is right in front, covering the entire horizon from one side to the other! The village is virtually in its lap. On its other sides the greenish blue hill ranges extend as far as eyes can see. One British foreign ambassador compared it with Switzerland. No exaggeration here. we did feel as if we went back to somewhere in the Interlaken area. Picture perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_1161" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1161" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011.jpg" alt="View from around Yoshino Sato" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00011-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View from around Yoshino Sato</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a kimono rental available in one of the cottages. Very thoughtfully it also offers rental for men. gorgeous samurai dress with armour headgear and sword! At a Very reasonable price. There was a queue. Queue for rental. Queue for taking photos at the best location &#8211; on the bridge over the stream with Mt Fuji in the background. Queues discourage some, but not our could-be queen. Statutory photos done, returned dress and headed for the other cottages. Each cottage serves to showcase some form of traditional Japanese art and craft. Wood craft, paper making, clay modeling etc. visitors can participate, and buy. Run under supervision by tourism authorities.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">And a bit of tragedy mixed&#8230;</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Originally the village was much larger. But the 1961 typhoon triggered major landslide destroying much of life and property. We sneaked in this one and that one, without really any particular interest. The day&#8217;s journey was beginning to take its toll. but then our junior most member came running up to us excitedly pointing to an yard between two cottages few feet below. Some kids, as well as their moms and dads were walking around on stilts! Well trying,mostly. Appeared that stilt walking was a tradition in these areas. To help tourists have a feel of the times the authorities kindly kept a few stilts. Both junior and senior sizes. Free to try. And so we did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By this time the sky turned orange. The peaks on the western horizon cast long shadows. Top of Mt. Fuji was no longer visible, covered in clouds. Time to return.</p>
<div id="attachment_1151" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1151" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00010.jpg" alt="Yoshino sato a picture postcard village" width="661" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00010.jpg 661w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJIFIVE00010-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yoshino sato a picture postcard village</p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Journey ends &#8230;till the next</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the time we reached station the sun was already gone, leaving only a reddish hue on the western sky. Street lights lit up. The kids seemed ready to fall into sleep anytime soon. It would be years later when they look back into photos of this day they will realize how lucky they were. A golden weekend at one of world&#8217;s iconic place. For now they were only too happy to have collected their mementos &#8211; lapel pins with writing Mt Fuji world heritage site. Train started. a huge golden moon was rising. It was full moon night. Reclined back into the seat. In two hours the neon lights of the mega city Tokyo would push us back into our cage. Bound by time. Till then&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mt. Takao a day trip from Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The river delta area of Tokyo is a wide valley, bordered by a ring of hills. These hills tend to change into mountain ranges in a few tens of kilometers further outback. Thus a walk in the mountains can always be part of a day trip. One of the most well known peaks for such a day trip is Mt Takao. Reachable in just about an hour from the center of the city, Mt Takao is both a trekkers pleasure and a cultural history enthusiasts delight. The other similar peak popular for easy reach in a days trip from Tokyo is Mt.Mitake. It is slightly farther, but more than that it is a more higher gradient making the trekking up slightly more challenging. So for more of a comfortable day trip from Tokyo, you may opt to visit Mt. Takao. Keio line train goes right upto the base TakaoSanGuchi from where one may start the walk up.</p>

Takao</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The walk up is known to be quite enjoyable. But for the benefit of the larger mass including yours only, there are alternatives as well, more than one actually. There is the all time favorite rope way, and there is also a cable car. Families with kids or the elderly need not worry or feel deprived!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On our part we opted for the ropeway on the way up. The rope way here is open chair type, with an iron bar separating one from ones perch up. For those with fear of height this may cause some Adrenalin rush as the path waves it way up. There are seven trategically placed photo cameras that catch your facial expressions and transmits wirelessly  up at the top station, printed ready for you to buy when you reach there! However this being Japan safety precautions are duly followed, in the form of a net below covering the entire ridge up all the way. So as you go up you feel the height, feel the excitement, but with your safety ensured. So its an experience to enjoy, if only after the ride ends!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once up at the rope way or the cable car station, take a look back. Beyond the green forest covered ridges, the high rises of Tokyo megapolis are faintly visible. At strategically positioned observation decks, there are coin operated telescopes to take a closer look at Tokyo Skytree and Tokyo tower.</p>
<div id="attachment_966" style="width: 331px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-966" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00003.jpg" alt="Walking through the green path" width="321" height="621" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00003.jpg 321w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00003-155x300.jpg 155w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00003-300x580.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Walking through the green path</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A mall area with a few food stalls greet visitors here. From here the walking path starts. For most the destination is Takao San temple, an old traditional complex with a monastery teaching students still the way it did centuries back. Families with kids take time out at a monkey park situated about half way up. Serious hikers go beyond the temple complex, cross the point marked top of the hill, and choose to take one of the many routes going back to civilization. At points in between there are rest areas with modest meal options. But being essentially a hill region the eateries tend to close early, with many being operated mainly during the spring-summer peak seasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the road goes higher and higher up, the cedars and maples on the two sides create a dense canopy above, with sun rays peeking in occasionally. At certain points the distant outline of the city is visible.  The chilly air at the higher altitude feels pleasant on summer days.</p>
<p>The walk winds through for a good two kilometers through forested path. The entire road is decorated by traditional style lanterns. Surely the autumn colours and the evening lights would make this trip magical. On the way there are small temples with ornamental gates, and  fortune rocks by the way side. The fortune rocks have messages carved on them. As you turn the wheel, whichever message the turning wheel comes to rest at, that is heaven&#8217;s wish for you. In its heydays the devoted walked up the entire path hoping for salvation through prayer at the monastery at the top. To make this journey comfortable, special variety cedar trees were planted along the way. Today after centuries passed these cedar trees are an attraction on their own, their gigantic widths resembling redwood trees of the American west.</p>
<div id="attachment_962" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-962" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAO00006.jpg" alt="The few food and souvenir shops on the way" width="501" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAO00006.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAO00006-300x228.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The few food and souvenir shops on the way</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monkey park falls somewhere midway. It is developed recently to add natural life diversity, and also make the journey a wholesome experience not only for the religious or the hikers but also for families with kids.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Temple and Monastery of Takao San</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The journey comes to its end as the temple/monastery complex is reached. The monastery complex is situated over at multiple levels, reachable by stairs. There, past the huge gate and past by the guardian deities, there are other statues, smaller temples, shops selling religious offerings. There is an observation deck. There are some snacks and drink huts that also sell souvenirs. The one thing that strikes one is that the monastery is devoid of the effects of commercialization that is evident in other religious places in  main city Tokyo or in Kamakura. The evening prayers and gongs still evoke a sense of being here for a greater purpose , living under a greater will. The intricate wood work have remained as it were since created hundreds of years ago.</p>
<div id="attachment_967" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-967" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00005.jpg" alt="Entering Takao San Temple Complex" width="381" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00005.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAOS00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Entering Takao San Temple Complex</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrow set of steps go up by the side of the monastery. Arrow head on wood points to the top of Mt Takao. A small flattened land up at the marked top point houses a plaque declaring this is the highest point in the entire greater Tokyo area!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can choose to take a different trail back down from the one you took to go up. The road remains crowded during the peak seasons of Sakura in Spring and Koyo fall colors in Autumn. Otherwise it&#8217;s quintessential hill, covered in trees, silent in meditation. As we reached the top, the sun decided to hide behind clouds. Rain drops soon started, the patter on the leaves joined the monotonous sound of the prayer chant coming from the temple nearby. We turned back.</p>
<div id="attachment_956" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-956" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAO00022.jpg" alt="Rain draped but beautiful path back to Takao Station" width="501" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAO00022.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TAKAO00022-300x228.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rain draped but beautiful path back to Takao Station</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the way back we decided to take the cable car. Soon we descended down to more familiar heights. The path back to the train station from the base of the cable car / rope way is also scenic, with a small ravine following beside all the way to the station. Traditional handicraft stalls on the two sides of the road give a colourful feel to the way. The rain stopped, but the dark clouds  stayed. Creating a landscape of higher contrast. The station complex itself has been redeveloped with heavy use of wood to match the surroundings. An Italian restaurant at the 1st floor with wide glass windows looking into the mountains is a nice place to pass some time by. We were game for a dash of freshly made pizzas. The restaurant seemed to be well stocked with choice of wines. And chocolates dessert, for us with our kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over all Mt.Takao is a highly recommendable experience, for a day out of the hustle and bustle of the great metropolis. With a mix of trekking / enjoying monkey park / praying at a centuries old monastery, its a great experience.  Look up the following link for relaxant journey timings and other details by Keio line</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mt Mitake a day trip from Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mt. Mitake is one of the two well known hill spots around Tokyo, the other being Mt. Takao. Both are in the west of Tokyo, connected by JR Chuo line within 1-1.5 hours distance from the heart of Tokyo. So both  Mt Takao and Mt Mitake can be visited in a day trip from Tokyo.  Mt.Takao or Takao San is more popular, being connected to a good part of the uphill journey via chair lifts and cable care. The path up from the lift/cable car stop is also easy on the gradient. But we will talk about Mt..Takao in another issue. Today let us hear about the trip to Mt.Mitake.</p>
<div id="attachment_926" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-926" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00007.jpg" alt="view from the mall at the base of the hiking path" width="561" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00007.jpg 561w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00007-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">view from the mall at the base of the hiking path</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Green pines and fir, steep slope, gorgeous wooden temple complex, fine views, that&#8217;s all that is there in Mt. Mitake as in Mt.Takao. What differentiates it from its more well known cousin is the rather steep slope, and dense woods. Whereas Takao san has a mix of cedars and pines, Mt.Mitake is almost exclusively covered by higher altitude foliage. The slopes also have caused the land to be more prone to landslides. In fact the map handed out at the Tourist center right outside the station clearly marks an area as risky due to landslides. Due to this dual reason of higher slopes and risk of landslides perhaps Mt.Mitake is less popular. But to purists, Mt.Takao could appear a bit too touristy, too tame. For a taste of real hiking up a mountain path, to see real old Japanese homes with thick layers of hay covering the tiled roofs, and to be able to pray at the yet non-embellished wooden altar centuries old, one needs to go to Mt. Mitake.</p>
<div id="attachment_929" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-929" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00010.jpg" alt="Contrast of colors - Mt Mitake" width="381" height="561" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00010.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00010-204x300.jpg 204w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00010-300x442.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Contrast of colors &#8211; Mt Mitake</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Going to Mt Mitake</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We happened to choose a clear sunny day one of these days in the Golden week holidays of 2016. To help tourist rush, JR operated direct trains from Tokyo via Shinjuku to Okutama, two stations short from Mitake. However being lazy on the holiday day we missed it, and boarded one that required us to change at Ome. Not a bad choice though, since the single line path from Ome offered a view altogether different from the familiar one. If we got the direct train we might not have noticed this change. As the elevation increased, residential quarters tended to be more unplanned, more with gardens. Houses changed into homes. And temples. Areas yet unaffected by the ever increasing boundaries of the great Metropolis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good number of people started getting down few stations before the train approached Mitake. Those were the places good for a days camping by the river Tama. The river curved its way here though a wider valley. We could see the silver reflections of it in places as the train chugged along. Tama river at Mt Mitake goes though a gorge, narrow and less suitable for picnic. Mitake is the place more suitable for climbing up, even though there is a canoeing zone right under the bridge across the station. It&#8217;s probably more patronized by the locals. For us. tourists we all headed out to our destination &#8211; up Mt.Mitake.</p>
<div id="attachment_927" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-927 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00008.jpg" alt="Hiking up to Mitake San" width="561" height="381" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00008.jpg 561w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00008-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hiking up to Mitake San</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The station was typical, on a slope, wooded, the station name-board still had the name curved on wood. Only the smart card enabled exit turnstile betrayed a touch of modernity. The tourist office right next to the station was well appointed with lots of brochures. We were pleasantly surprised to see availability of English language maps. Of course there was another family seemingly from Eastern Europe. So tourists do seem to frequent Mitake as well even though that day we were the only two gaijin families amongst all the crowd.</p>
<div id="attachment_931" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-931" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00013.jpg" alt="The way was covered by the tall evergreens" width="381" height="561" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00013.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00013-204x300.jpg 204w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00013-300x442.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The way was covered by the tall evergreens</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first we would board a cable car that will take us up till a point. From there the hiking route starts. A bus leaves from near the station. Goes till the base of the cable car “caburu shita”. 5 minutes trip. From where the bus dropped us, at cabru shita, we started getting a feel of the slope. About thirty forty meters away is the cable car station. One car goes up as another comes down, crossing in the middle. The full cable car path is a steep incline &#8211; quite, repeat quite steep. Its felt especially when one stands next to the driver in front, on the way down. We got our tickets, stepped into the car next to the driver, camera ready in one hand and the hand rail tightly grabbed with the other hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_933" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-933" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00015.jpg" alt="Village huts on the way" width="381" height="561" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00015.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00015-204x300.jpg 204w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00015-300x442.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Village huts on the way</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The gradient was well um exciting. Tad too exciting, forgot to take pictures. Anyway at the top there is a view pavilion, with a few eateries cum souvenir shops. We decided to have our fill of ramen here, then headed up. The walk is scenic, as the rows of blue hills in horizon appeared clear on that sunny day. The path weaved through places darkened by tall pines and firs. In between there were a few houses, some fairly old with olden day hay covered roofs but all very well maintained. In between there were Tories, vermilion colored wooden gates with inscriptions on them. And there were stone tablets all the way up perhaps reminding us of the great tales of noble men and / or reminding one of the sayings of Lord Buddha.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At one point the number of houses increased to more than a few, and a few shops selling memorabilia also graced the two sides of the narrow path. The road was very steep. But we could not afford to look tired or afraid, as along with us there were a group of fairly aged Japanese men and women. And they seemed to be able to manage fairly well!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we trailed on. The appearance of the shops and houses indicated to us our destination might not be much farther. That was wishful thinking though. The houses and shops were there because they got the space there, that&#8217;s all. The path extended farther up. There again were another set of Tories, and another unending set of stairs going up.</p>
<div id="attachment_924" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-924" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00005.jpg" alt="The old style dwellings are still a part of this locality" width="381" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00005.jpg 381w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00005-228x300.jpg 228w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/MITAKE00005-300x394.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The old style dwellings are still a part of this locality</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point the stairs ended into a wider platform. By that time the sun tilted towards west, coloring the sky with Orange hue. We finally reached the top. Felt like real mountaineer on top of summit. Rows of very tall and old trees guarded the main temple and the sub temples around. Unfortunately part of the main temple was draped due to ongoing maintenance work. But the view otherwise from the top, supplemented by the austere wooden sub temples, bells and bell towers presented a view of olden days Japan. We felt a sense of accomplishment. We did reach the top through hard work, and earned this view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wind started picking up speed. So decided to head back down. On our way we happened to meet the expat American teacher at our kids school. Conveyed pleasantries, moved ahead. The way up seemed pretty stiff. But the way down seemed more difficult. But again there were the old and the very young giving us company. So the journey was tempered by admiration for others and admonishing for self for not being fit enough. Promised to self to exercise more, spend less time browsing and more time jogging. er walking.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Took a break as we reached back at the cable car station. My inner self reasoned I deserved an energy boost. And guided me to a place selling strawberry ice creams, with real strawberry bits and real cream. It tasted heavenly. It really was, not just my tiredness silly! In any case licking the strawberry cream sitting at the pavilion facing the distant range of hills, time quickly slipped by. We queued back at the cable car platform. In a few minutes reached the bus stop below. Few minutes more and there we were back at the oldy looking wooden station. This time we did not miss the direct holiday special to Tokyo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In summary it was a day well spent. A day of golden week &#8211; shall we say a golden day? Looking back, yes it was a very memorable day, call it by any name. Do let me know how did you feel if you have been to Mt Mitake.  If not yet,then make sure you plan it your next long weekend. Cheers</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Winter, in Japan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chilly air, crisp morning, hot coffee, white white and white as far as eyes can see. Or, speeding down swerving zig zag through powdery snow in an exhilarating journey down from top. Imageries that conjure up in a city birds mind as the skiing season comes by. December in Japan is unique amongst a broad swath of countries in Asia as it is the only country with Olympic standard skiing facilities in the region. The north wind ushers in a huge cache of snow across the West of Honshu all the way starting from the Hokkaido island in North. No wonder that Santa gets company of young upwardly mobile crowd flying in from neighboring China to as far as Australia, and Singapore.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s go on a day out</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But folks of all kinds may not have had that luxurious trip booked an year back. Or say you just thought yureka lets get go for skiing! For such folks, there are Quite a few options for a quick last minute hop onto the slopes. Swipe your credit card, get into a Shinkansen bullet train and ski out straight as you alight at Yuzawa. You can have a fine day trip skiing in a world class facility.<br />
<a href="http://www.galaresort.jp › winter › english" target="_blank">www.galaresort.jp › winter › english</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now say you are a newbie, or you have kids whom you want to introduce to the joys of skiing, a shinkansen trip may be a little too ambitious. You want a quick day trip, safe gradient with kid-friendly facilities, open to last minute booking and kinda easy on pockets. And you also want it to be memorable by way of having visited one iconic location of Japan. Ahem. Close your eyes, Abra ka dabra. yay you got it. Take a bus trip to Fujiten!!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">A day Skiing on Mt Fuji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes friends there is indeed a ski resort right at the foot of Mt Fuji, offering gorgeous views while having facilities to enthrall newbies as well as experienced alike. Not being on the main ski area map though, Fujiten is generally more available compared to other facilities in mainland Japan such as Hakuba or Niigata. And yes you can go in the morning, have a 7 hour ski session and come back home by 8pm in the evening, all taken care of for half a grand (5000 yen) per person. Rentals extra. Irresistible, do you think so? Then read on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several bus companies traveling between Fujiten and Tokyo. A very popular service with multiple departure points in Tokyo is run by Orion tours (<a href="http://www.orion-ski.jp/sp/" target="_blank">http://www.orion-ski.jp/sp/</a>). As usual if you have been following the articles on this site, you are advised to use Chrome browser and Google translate to convert the Japanese to English. It&#8217;s workable, so long as you know what you want. Select destination, select date, select package ( with or without ski rental), make payment, and you are all set. Ticket includes ski lift charges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how we, your Team Couchflyer, made a one day trip recently to Fujiten. Being largely weighted on the newbie side, we chose the safest option namely all rentals included (no thinking needed) package. But it was worth it, especially if you consider the steps involved in choosing what to rent what not to rent once you are there, and do the conversation largely in sign language!.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All set we started on a sunny morning. The bus was full of students, reported “sick” in college, presumably. Some trying to hang onto their missed hours of morning dozing, after ahh ahem late night studies. Some Kawai ones busy with makeup. We kept ourselves busy recalling the steps seen on YouTube How To learn ski boarding in 30 minutes video the previous evening. It would be easy, we kind of all thought as we looked at one another.</p>
<div id="attachment_629" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-629 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00003-300x300.jpg" alt="Land of Snow White" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00003-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00003-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00003.jpg 809w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Land of Snow White</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a short while the bus left the big city behind. Snow capped mountains appeared closer and closer. The bus switched to lower gear as the road started ascending, adding a deep groan to the otherwise sedate scenes passing us by.</p>
<div id="attachment_628" style="width: 215px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-628 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00002-205x300.jpg" alt="Mt Fuji beckoning" width="205" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00002-205x300.jpg 205w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00002-300x439.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00002.jpg 553w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mt Fuji beckoning</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We could see the tops of the roller coaster of Fujikyu Highland, a sprawling amusement park at the base of Mt Fuji. The towering peak of Mt Fuji kept us guiding as we proceeded on our journey into its lap. Snow zone started.</p>
<div id="attachment_625" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-625 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00009-300x156.jpg" alt="FUjikyu highland" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00009-300x156.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00009-768x399.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00009-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00009.jpg 1065w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">FUjikyu highland</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Forest of silvery white birch trees, shorn of leaves, stood in contrast to occasional green of spruce and pines. Log houses, rambling road curving its way up, all indicated we were in ski country. Snow frozen on the branches of the trees turned into crystals shining bright in morning sun. Not long after our driver san announced our arrival at destination.</p>
<div id="attachment_630" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-630 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00004-300x300.jpg" alt="Glistening crystals of ice" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00004-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00004-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00004-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00004.jpg 809w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Glistening crystals of ice</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was fairy white everywhere around, with distant peaks appearing in light blue shades on the horizon against a deep blue sky. The rentals being all prearranged it was a quick process for us to get all set and hit the slopes.</p>
<div id="attachment_622" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-622" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00006.jpg" alt="Skiing with Mt Fuji in the backdrop" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00006.jpg 809w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00006-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00006-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Skiing with Mt Fuji in the backdrop</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We trained ourselves for snow boarding, so started with it. Walk up the slope with one foot lugging the board, turn, step into the other socket, lean sideways, and zoom. Well that was the theory. The practicalities were to be different. Somebody forgot to attach brakes. So we found ourselves more slipping and hitting the ground than sliding down like the fellow on YouTube. Our junior most member in the team soon rebelled. It was not quite the fun he envisioned!!!<br />
So change of tack. Boards swapped for skiis we went back to the slopes. This time it was better. Soon the team gained confidence to go higher up and ski down together. The ski lifts took us up almost to a touching distance of the top of mighty Mt Fuji. Sun rays fused through the bare branches. Barring the occasional excitement of us skiers it was quiet up there. A snow scooter lay idle, as a emergency vehicle to aid someone in distress. Safety is paramount in Japanese culture, living as it were through a constant threat of earth quakes and tsunamis.</p>
<div id="attachment_623" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-623" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00007.jpg" alt="Taking the lifts to the top" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00007.jpg 809w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00007-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00007-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Taking the lifts to the top</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only safety though, consumer convenience is also of prime importance. So no points for guessing that there will be a drinks vending machine ready to serve there at the top of the slope!</p>
<div id="attachment_641" style="width: 211px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-641" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKIV00001.jpg" alt="Are you being served?" width="201" height="281" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Are you being served?</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On our way here in the morning we noticed quite a few warning signs cautioning motorists to presence of wild deer and monkeys. Not sure if they would bother to come up this high but the two sides were dense forests suitable for wild habitat. Snow flakes solidified into crystals, hanging from the branches and shrubs. The powdery slope curved its way below through the midst of the forest. Not one but there were several slopes suiting various skill levels. Snow boarders, skiiers broke through the silence as they hurled below, creating and recreating tracks on their wake. We joined them, several times as we skiied down and came back up by the lifts.</p>
<div id="attachment_621" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-621" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00005.jpg" alt="Down the slopes" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00005.jpg 809w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00005-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00005-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Down the slopes</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant facilities in the resort were upto the mark, with several restaurants serving fares of different types, including ice creams! Spicy ramen did the favour for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The post lunch session was more leisurely, more fun than sports. This included sliding down sitting on a skiboard, taking selfies and action photos, not to mention taking lots of snaps of Mt Fuji shining in the background. Evening falls fast in hills. The sun rays turned a glorious yellow, shadows grew longer. It was time to say goodbye.</p>
<div id="attachment_624" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-624 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00008-300x217.jpg" alt="Shadows in Evening glow " width="300" height="217" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00008-300x217.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00008.jpg 482w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Shadows in Evening glow</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We boarded the bus back. everyone was tired, but satisfied. As the bus winded its way back past the villages and towns, Mt Fuji appeared all the while towering above. As if it was guarding the hamlets below. We were sleepy, the headlights of the passing vehicles were breaking the stupor as we dozed off. After a while how long we didn&#8217;t know the bus slowed down, on the outside there were suqare patterns of dots on a black background. We reached the big city, passing by the skyscrapers of Shinjuku.</p>
<div id="attachment_626" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-626" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00010.jpg" alt="Bye bye Fuji san" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00010.jpg 809w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00010-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00010-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FUJISKI00010-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bye bye Fuji san</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day ended. We did go out ski on the slopes of Mt Fuji. A royal day out indeed&#8230;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tofukuji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The night opened into another cloudy day. Weather was expected to clear out in the second half after a light drizzle. Today it is a journey to the south, south of Kyoto. We will take JR Nara line from Kyoto station. A small toy train like 2 compartment train stood at the designated platform. Destination Tofukuji. People from around Japan come to Toukuji for its autumn colors.</p>
<div id="attachment_604" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-604" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021-300x210.jpg" alt="JR Nara line to Tofukuji" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021-300x210.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021-130x90.jpg 130w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">JR Nara line to Tofukuji</p></div>
<div id="attachment_610" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-610" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006-300x228.jpg" alt="Way to Tofukiji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to Tofukiji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path out of the station was narrow and perhaps would have benefited from more direction in English. Google maps saved. There is a way that runs parallel to the railway track and another one takes left. Seeing a temple on the left, we ignored the GPS directions and walked towards it. It turned out to be a family temple of some vintage. Thankfully local volunteers posted directions at points along the way to Tofukuji. It helped us navigate our way back.</p>
<div id="attachment_609" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-609" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005-300x228.jpg" alt="Viewing bridge, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Viewing bridge, Tofukuji</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But this short detour uncovered a part of Kyoto that would have remained unseen otherwise. The two sides of the way leading to Tofukuji are residences of priests each calling a temple home. The temples on the two sides were gorgeous at one time no doubt but perhaps fell in disuse over time. The tradition of dispensing traditional food from the temples continues still, though in a more commercial way. Food kiosks are set up on the gates run by family members of respective house holds.</p>

<div id="attachment_612" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-612" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010-300x228.jpg" alt="Head priests tomb, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Head priests tomb, Tofukuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon the high boundary walls of Tofukuji, partially draped in bamboo groves, came into view. The way inside the familiar Torii gate was covered in gravels, it was wide and had a boulevard kind of appearance. Trees neatly trimmed, sign posts welcome visitors. The path came to a wide crossing, flanked on two sides by priests quarters and ticket gate.</p>
<div id="attachment_602" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-602" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019-300x228.jpg" alt="Moss covered garden, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Moss covered garden, Tofukuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way from the ticket gate headed left. We entered into a covered wooden veranda. The walkway led to a garden path down stone-steps. Further ahead it becomes a bridge over a small stream. The entire garden, the valley, the stream and the way up the passage, everywhere it was a riot of colors. If there was a God of Autumn, she might have left the most precious gems from her collection in here. Somewhat strikingly, this was a zen temple meditating in steadfast austerity, in the middle of unabashed beauty around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The covered passage went up in steps, turned, turned again, and reached up to the top. The main hall of prayer stood there. Heavy wooden doors of a courtyard opened in. Inside, a stone paved road went straight on to the base of the shrine. On one side lay a lily pond. with gold fish swimming around. The other side there was this  rock garden covered in sand, marked in linear zen patterns. At one end there was a wooden sitting area, thoughtfully positioned to let the visitors spend some time in silent introspection. Chance for us to take in the sights and sounds in, at our own pace. Tourists from around the world came in, sat quietly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting back up, we stepped into the garden. Maple and Japanese pines lined the paths. Green moss was covered with scattered red and yellow maple leaves. A set of stone obelisks stood under a maple, witness to the times. The maple covered walk descended in steps down towards the stream. A little stone bridge crossed the ravine, and went up the mossy garden route back to the wooden walkway. As we crossed the bridge, and went few steps up the stone paved route,  the complete wooden bridge and the veranda came into view. Not quite complete, to be honest, as part of it was bedecked in maple colors. The sky partially cleared, with streaks of blue being visible.  Sun shone through the leaves. It was a panorama fit for artists easel. It was nature&#8217;s own painting, may be by Benzaiten the God of art herself!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">  The way back was a dramatic change, sudden descent from the heavenly to the mundane. The underside of the overhead train-line cast its shadow beneath. The road was narrow. Dwellings showed the marks of time, and perhaps of downward fortunes. Ironically, one thought, it&#8217;s perhaps how things in life are meant to be like. Without the contrast being there, the beauty left behind would not have appeared so precious, so surreal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We reached the small station. Next stop was immediately the next station on the same line &#8211; Fushimi Inari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continued&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Continued from before&#8230;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ginkakuji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After Kinkakuji next destination was Ginkakuji. We wandered back to the bus stop, world heritage sign pointing backwards. Time for a quick time check. Finished lunch at the 1st floor small but cosy glass covered family run restaurant. right by the crossing. Then it was time to head back to the city center. The next destination Ginkakuji, was in the eastern fringe. Ginkakuji was originally a retirement villa, similar to Kinkakuji. It was set up by the grandson of the Shogun who originally built Kinkakuji. So it had similar streaks of grand ambition, but in between the two generations economic situation changed. Cultural mores also changed. Thus the style used in Ginkakuji turned out to be different from its predecessor and inspiration. Unbeknownst to the creators at that time, Ginkakuji style started the next era in Japanese cultural and architectural heritage. So it was naturally the next item on our itinerary; we simply followed directions.</p>

<div id="attachment_583" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-583" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006-300x228.jpg" alt="Ginkakuji side view" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginkakuji side view</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bus from Kyoto station reach Ginkakuji in about 40 minutes. As we reached, we noticed the area was still the outskirts of the main city. Even after 500 years, and anointment as world heritage site, the ambiance around afforded a village like feel  Not bad for retirement even now, quipped my companion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the ticket gate, the narrow lane leads to a wooden door. The main shrine comes into view as one steps past the door onto the other side. It`s wooden pagoda style multi storied structure has borne the brunt of many typhoons and earthquakes but standing tall. Built by a lily pond, its name Ginakuji, the silver shrine, is said to have come from its reflections in the pond on a moonlit night.</p>
<div id="attachment_582" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-582" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013-300x228.jpg" alt="Ginkakuji hall of Amida Buddha " width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginkakuji hall of Amida Buddha</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A circular path curled its way from the left of the shrine past several wooden buildings, crossing over a stream, onto a ridge and back down to the other side of Ginkakuji. This whole area was only for the eyes of the Shogun, to rest his mind from the turmoils of bruising past.</p>
<div id="attachment_574" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-574" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020-300x243.jpg" alt="Ginkakuji Shoguns liibrary" width="300" height="243" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020-300x243.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020-1024x829.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020.jpg 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginkakuji Shoguns liibrary</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right at the beginning of the walk, once comes across a sand pit with a sand obelisk in the middle. Very Shinto-like, uniquely different from the zen style in Kinkakuji. The sand layer had delicately carved lines sketched across, as if to represent the marks of time on the eternal. Next as we walked past another gate, we were ushered into the outer garden. This was a wide boulevard around the lily pond, with bridges and bamboo groves carving a leisurely path around it. On one side of the garden there was this prayer hall, with intricately carved Amida Buddha statue inside. Next was the library.  The path forked here, one going up the hill bordering the estate. The entire path is not open to visitors. Even then from atop  one gets a commanding view of the Kyoto city, with mountains in distance. We reached the high point about time the sun was setting. The red afternoon glow made the whole view magical. Autumn colors of Japanese maple trees blazed in red and orange.</p>
<div id="attachment_578" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-578" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011-1024x777.jpg" alt="Evening from top Ginkakuji" width="660" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Evening from top Ginkakuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was not hard to imagine  how Ginkakuji would have come to influence the following generations of artisans and authors in Japan. The Shogun, the commander of the mighty army bowing to the supreme nature in all humility, presented the plot around which many playacts were made.  It was an expression of the power  of the subtle, the silent, that eventually subsumes the egoistic boundaries of man.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As we stood there viewing the last rays of the sun, amidst the bunch of tourists assembled from across the world, we kind of felt like we were  actors in a play. In this play of history, the audience were the hills the maple tress the bamboo groves the lily pond the tea room the prayer halls. The script remained sane for hundreds of years, only  the actors changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day was about to bid adieu. The red glow of the evening sky lengthened  the shadows falling on the water.  It was time to head back to reality. The sloping way back through the village drew villagers into the path of the tourists. A glance and a bow followed a hesitant smile. Rows of curio shops beckoned by the pavement. We headed back to the bus stop. Next day would be a very busy day. We would need to download the photos, recharge the camera/phone/tablet,  miles to go before we sleep.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Continued from <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/autumn-in-kyoto-part-i/">https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/autumn-in-kyoto-part-i/</a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kinkakuji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next morning we started early. Our destination &#8211; Kinkakuji, in the north west of the city. Subway seemed to be the faster option. From Subway Kitaoji station, it&#8217;s a short bus or taxi ride. We were excited. Kinkakuji is said to be the living representation of the Japan seen in calendars and travel magazines.</p>
<div id="attachment_545" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-545" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025.jpg" alt="Way to Kinkakuji" width="690" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025.jpg 690w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to Kinkakuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Established by feudal lord in the golden era of Kyoto, it stands to embody the highest echelons of Japanese traditions and philosophy.  Originally a retirement villa, it was a private estate surrounding a lake at the base of a hill. Later on it was converted into zen Buddhist shrine. The entire area comprising of the hill, the lake and the valley around makes Kinkakuji. The central villa is crowned in golden tiles, from which the name Kinakuji the &#8220;golden pavilion&#8221; originated.</p>
<div id="attachment_544" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00024.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-544" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00024.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji the golden pavilion" width="341" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00024.jpg 341w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00024-232x300.jpg 232w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00024-300x388.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kinkakuji the golden pavilion</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Entering the complex</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bus dropped us at a corner. World heritage signs caught attention. Even in the chilly morning, a steady stream of visitors were heading up the path pointed to by the sign. A paved road went through a garden full of cedar and maple. It is second week of November.</p>
<div id="attachment_540" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020.jpg"><img class="wp-image-540 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020-300x230.jpg" alt="Way to Kinkakuji" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to Kinkakuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The greenery was already thinning, replaced by bright colors of Red and orange. The two sides of the bamboo-fenced road were bright and cheerful in clear morning sun. The underside of the trees was covered with a thick carpet of green moss. At one point the road divided into two, one going straight in through the entry gate (Torii) and the other coming out of the exit in the right. We stopped several times on our way towards the Torii, trying to capture the morning rays shining onto the green carpet through the colored foliage. But the steady stream of tourists played spoilsport. It was a reminder that its fall season in Kyoto, and we were right in front of one of the best known world heritage sites. The crowd was to be expected. No option, so we  moved on along with the crowd.</p>
<div id="attachment_553" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-553" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji a closer view" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kinkakuji a closer view</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entering through the Torii, at once we found ourselves facing a vast garden. The vastness of the garden was a sudden change from the busy outside. It was a vast expanse of land with manicured trees, bell tower, lily pond, bridge. The rush of people became slow, people trying to reconcile with the vastness of it all. The buzz quietened down. It was as if a scripted act. Done to prepare the visitors for the imminent next stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another gate stood protecting the path to the final inner sanctum. Time to get our tickets. Past the ticket gate we headed through a narrow path. It opened into a wide vista. There Kinkakuji appeared, right in front of our eyes, shining, its reflection shimmering in the lake. Ducks swimming. Mild breeze buzzing through a bamboo grove nearby.</p>
<div id="attachment_549" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-549" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji views" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kinkakuji views</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shadow of white clouds on a blue sky played with the reflection of the golden pagoda in water. Gold fishes were swimming around the lake shore, unafraid. Peace. Tranquility. Eternal calm, yes this was it. It was a moment for reflection.</p>
<div id="attachment_551" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-551" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji through autumn foliage" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kinkakuji through autumn foliage</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walking by</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrow clay walking path led towards the pavilion. We moved, we stood, took in the view, and moved again. A clutch of thatched houses by the right separated themselves by a fence. These ones house the monks who continue to live the centuries old traditions.  Japanese pine bent up on left, by the golden pavilions. Maple grove behind the golden pavilion led up a narrow path uphill. Red orange colored maple leaf floated in water, lay around on green moss covered hillside, lay under feet up the stone paved stairs going up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the hilltop, there was a tea room, opening its view towards the vast estate down below. The master stood here, offering the cup of green elixir in obeisance before taking the first sip. In mornings, in evenings, days and nights, the aroma filled in as the thoughts reverberated through the air. Karma is said to live through lives, reappearing through reincarnations.  Was that a reason all these seemed so familiar, seen long ago?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Uh the nudge from fellow traveler woke me up. Continued on the path that now wound down the other side. We found ourselves by a private courtyard, lived in, living the life lived by generations before. A family busy in daily life, watering the gardens, washing and hanging clothes on the clothesline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A normal day to day life, differentiated only by the fact that it is a life of a privileged, life unhindered by stress of civilization outside.</p>
<div id="attachment_537" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00017.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-537" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00017.jpg" alt="Kyoto maple colors" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00017.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00017-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kyoto maple colors</p></div>
<div id="attachment_536" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00016.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-536" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00016.jpg" alt="Green moss carpet under red and orange canopy" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00016.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00016-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Green moss carpet under red and orange canopy</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The road headed past around into the prayer hall. Devotees were kneeling, clasping their arms in Pranam posture, lighting incense sticks. Smoke curled up from the bronze stand. We stood, observing as the light and shadow played in the portals of the wooden building. The rush of the morning, the excitement, all seemed to unwarranted, so unbecoming of where we were to come to. It was not a place to visit, but a place to be in, to blend, to belong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kinkakuji is Japan. Quintessential Japan. At least that is the Japan I always envisioned. Ah, we envisioned, the milling millions who passed by the gates of this hallowed precinct for hundreds of years gone by. And will pass by. Join them o reader, by all means if you can. Aum.</p>
