				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kyosumi Garden One Traditional Japanese Garden In Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best traditional Japanese styles garden in Tokyo is in this sleepy east part of Tokyo, Kyosumi Garden. Once it was a private garden, belonging to Mitsubishi group. In the Meiji era this was the property of Mitsubishi patriarch Kinokuniya San. From then till now &#8211; over last close to hundred and fifty years this area of Tokyo has undergone a sea change. But this one garden has been well preserved under care of Mitsubishi group. Being accessible only to company high ranking officials and their guests this garden maintained its originality, oblivious of all the rapid changes happening around.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3240.8507755459514!2d139.79561561491894!3d35.680676180194375!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6018893e17559757%3A0xf238b51ea3c37819!2sKiyosumi+Garden!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1475903959614" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was built around a central pond, with wooden bridges, tea house, undulating small hills and valleys, forests full of Japanese pines, maples,  junipers, and bamboo groves. Stone steps led to the bridge below an artificial waterfall. Water worn old stones having specific religious bearings were shipped in from distant places around Japan and positioned carefully in the landscape. The ambiance is still there.</p>
<div id="attachment_1098" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1098" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg" alt="One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One best preserved Japanese garden in Tokyo</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it&#8217;s maintained by local government. For a minimal entry fee charged. It&#8217;s a few minutes walk from Toei Oedo line or Hanzomon line Kyosumi Shirakawa station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being somewhat away from the city center and key tourist attractions, the surroundings still bear the distant old Japan look. No Mc burgers, save for Denny&#8217;s if you plan for a lunch nearby. Neither too many Izakayas &#8211; the Japanese restaurants.. Traditional residential area. Shops still actually sell fresh veg produce in wooden baskets!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The walking route</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once inside you might like to follow the Arrow pointing towards the walking route. If you don&#8217;t though, you won&#8217;t be lost since there&#8217;s not many paths to choose from anyway. Walk towards the central pond, keep walking around anti clockwise. Go Past the walkway made of stone slabs. Step Across the bridge. Make your way over the stones underneath which the goldfish and the turtles laze around. Take the walk up the small tree-covered slope. Take your time. The view from here encompasses the entire water body surrounded by the green hills with a central tea room. The entire panorama in one frame. There are benches for the ones wishing to take the view in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1096" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1096" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg" alt="Panoramic view point" width="501" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001.jpg 501w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00001-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Panoramic view point</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path goes further ahead passing around the tea room. It&#8217;s restricted access no peeking around please. The walkway divides. An adjacent garden comes into view. There is a wooden pavilion, and several wooden barbecue style tables. Good for taking a bento break. This area is sometimes used by those modern yoga healing classes.</p>
<div id="attachment_1099" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1099" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg" alt="The creek of Pines" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00004-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The creek of Pines</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walk Back</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From here visitors head back to the walking course that snakes behind the tea room and heads towards a narrow creek. Gold Fishes crowd around the creek. A few weather worn stones, with Japanese maples cedars and ferns growing around them create an image of a land far off. Pristine. Where waterfalls glisten in the morning sunshine, gurgling down the quiet valley. Curiously a stork some day found its way here, and since called this place home.</p>
<div id="attachment_1100" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1100" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg" alt="Time for a break" width="741" height="261" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005.jpg 741w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI00005-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Time for a break</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pathway past this point again starts going up.  Turns left once the Stone lamp stand comes into view. A lane goes straight ahead, heading towards the lily beds. Another forks left towards a green island, past a small bridge.</p>
<div id="attachment_1103" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-1103 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg" alt="The bridge towards the central island" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200002.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The bridge towards the central island</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1102" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1102" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg" alt="A hazy winter morning" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KYOSUMI200001.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A hazy winter morning</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The walk ends at a traditional ryokan style hall, glass  covered, with extended wooden patio. The grass lawn and the pebbled walkways merge back where the arrow said Start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Autumn is said to be the best time to enjoy this park. It&#8217;s amongst one of the sites to enjoy Fall colors right in Tokyo. At other times also, it does not fail to impress. A break from the civilized world for a couple of hours. Priceless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Science museum Tokyo &#8211; A day out for kids</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When your eight year old runs around chasing the heavy ball as it glides in its path, you know it was good outing. Science museum is the place for learning the sciences in the most enjoyable way possible. If you are planning to help your kid enjoy learning, you cant be wrong with a day out in Science museum.  Crank that shaft, push that lever, turn the pulley, things move. A chapter of mechanics done. Could things be any better?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The imposing 5 storied white building inside Kitanomarukoen, Imperial palace gardens, has a huge number of displays. And not just displays, there are a large number of hands-on experiment sessions that run every hour, separately in each floor. It becomes difficult which one to choose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first floor is the ticketing area and souvenir shop. The display halls start from second floor. Each floor has about four halls with their own exhibits. A central atrium on each floor has a few minor or accompanying displays, a sitting area for the tired visitors and extended area for cafeteria.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2nd floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second floor focuses on basics of machines, and motion. One hall here has display of bicycles, starting from old wooden ones through till modern day varieties. Another hall looks at cars. Most young crowd tend to spend a good amount of time in this area as there are real driving experiences to have. One can drive a real full size truck -stepping into the drivers cabin, pressing the accelerators and controlling the driving wheel! Only the truck does not move, but simulates driving with a big LCD screen showing in front as if the driver is navigating city traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then next there is a full size car with its innards bared open, covered with glass. A driver can sit, press the accelerator, turn the driving wheel. There will be real engine sound, and gears and pistons will move. There is also a motor bike with real working accelerators and turn sensors.</p>
<div id="attachment_891" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-891" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003.jpg" alt="Simulated driving of cars" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Simulated driving of cars</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another hall teaches all about levers, pulleys and forces. For that it has a full cage in the shape of a large spring circling around the hall. A heavy metal ball moves through the cage as it is pushed forward. There are obstacles in between in the cage, where the viewers have to push a lever or pull a pulley so that the ball continues to move ahead. It requires several people to work together so that the ball can move around. And these people quickly become friends helping each other with that little extra power to lift the lever and push the ball through. Then there is the pulley mechanism that allows kids to lift a whole car &#8211; a real car! And then there is the pulley and gear arrangement that lets two kids rotate two dials and move a set of sticks that beat a set of drums. All these to teach about how gears work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3rd floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor next up is the Denki floor, teaches kids about electricity. Starting with Fleming&#8217;s three finger rule, it shows in a simple but interesting way how magnets and copper wire can be used to generate electricity. Then shows how wind energy is used to generate electricity. There are ample ways to engage the youngsters. One can play with every exhibit, see how the volt meter reading changes with action. And not just volt meters, one can paddle an exercise bike that generates electricity then creates magnetism and pulls up bits of metal. Several bikes in a row with colorful display scales on the wall are enough to make a bunch of kids engage in fierce cycling and seeing who can reach the maximum height on the scales.</p>
<div id="attachment_892" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-892" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00004.jpg" alt="Earths magnetosphere and aurora" width="281" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00004.jpg 281w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00004-162x300.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Earths magnetosphere and aurora</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from such exhibits, there are live experiment classes held every hour. Care is taken to ensure the presentations are understandable to even the tiniest of participants. While being interesting to all. It&#8217;s difficult to do it, and perhaps even more difficult to explain. Let us not even try to explain either, because that will be a kill joy. You should experience it yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same 3rd floor there is a slightly different exhibit, with a curious looking sets of metal horns poking out of floor and walls. The horns are not dissimilar to the ones one see in old gramophone pictures. One is supposed to listen on the gramophone like end. These play the sound generated by earth&#8217;s magnetosphere when hit by solar plasma. Clearly in the audible range these are strange extraterrestrial sounds, somewhat hypnotic. We actually came back once more to listen to these sounds, as strange and magical as it were. You may have heard these sounds in NASA TV programs, in those ones talking about deep space journeys and extra terrestrial life. In that hall there was another display again dwelling on the subject of earth&#8217;s magnetosphere and Auroras seen in north and south poles. Here it was like a movie on a giant LCD screen. Viewers could sit and see the effect of plasma rays on our atmosphere as the colors of aurora swept across the screen in a surreal display.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4th floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The fourth floor next above focused on liquids and minerals. For kids there was this podium on which as a kid stepped, a hand cranked ring would go up enveloping him/ her in a soap bubble. Blowing the soap bubble out the kids stepped down as if a prince or princess coming off his/her magical chariot. Expect long queue here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Same 4th floor in another hall, named Constrium, exhibits showed the latest in building construction technology.  Here one could see how earth quakes occur, and how Japanese buildings are engineered to absorb the shocks. We reached in time for a live experiment class that explained the different types of shock waves and their varying effects on small low rise buildings versus high rises. On a table there were two glass plates. The plates had a small separation allowing one to move with respect to the other. The lower one was made to vibrate, simulating quake waves, as the instructor turned some knobs. With one kind of wave the tall building wobbled, with another the short one was vibrating. The instructor explained the traditional engineering how old Japanese buildings were protected with diagonally places planks between the upper and lower floors. She mentioned the same principle is used in construction of the tallest building in Tokyo &#8211; the Tokyo Sky Tree. Next she demonstrated how putting a little jar one third full of water at the top floor of the tall building helped reduce the effect earth quakes in the building. This is the reason the natural disaster prevention booklets tell us to keep the bathtubs partially filled. Would not have realized how important this simple step is, if we did not see the demo.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5th floor</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But probably the most impactful exhibits were at the 5th floor optics and optical illusion area. The design patterns on a plane wall can make us think the walls are curved, or the angle of walls can make us think we are on an incline! These were all demonstrations of how our eyes make us perceive our surroundings. In one exhibit one stands in the center of a platform. The wall in front had a whirling design. This wall started rotating in a circle. Immediately one felt like the entire platform started moving in circle along with the wall. This was based on visual feedback. Instinctively our body tried to balance. But the sensory feedback from rest of the body did not support the feeling of movement, resulting in our body feeling strangely out of sync. In simple terms, we felt fooled, out of control of our own body!</p>
<div id="attachment_889" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-889" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00002.jpg" alt="Pulleys and Levers" width="281" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00002.jpg 281w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SCIMUS00002-162x300.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pulleys and Levers</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the floors and the halls held exhibits of that made impact in one way or the other. If however still your little one was  not impressed, there is the old favorite King Kong, siting in a cage. It senses movement. Kids can go up a small ladder to peek inside the cage. King Kong roars. This one does leave an impression, trust me.</p>
<p>Despite such superb collection, the center maintains a relatively low profile though compared to more recent ones like Miraikan or  Panasonic Risupia or Sony Explora science. You can follow the links here to read more about those.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/panasonic-risupia-science-for-kids/" target="_blank">Panasonic Risupia</a></p>
<p>This center is somewhat more academic, more focusing on the fundamentals. That is not to say it is less interesting in any way. Rather one may argue to the contrary in some senses.</p>
<p>The easiest approach if going by public transport is to get down at Kudanshita station and walk for approx ten minutes. Well seven minutes, to be precise as per the center. For the latest information on exhibits, timing and prices please follow this URL</p>

<div id="attachment_859" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-859" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00003.jpg" alt="Yozakura cherry blossoms in evening" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yozakura cherry blossoms in evening</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a flower Sakura i.e. cherry blossom is light pink a delicate little one that blooms just for about two weeks. End of winter, beginning of spring. Unlike others though its a highly social kind, comes together goes together. After a light rain someday end of March, as night turns to day suddenly the entire neighborhood is flush with flowers. Not a single leaf, just bunch of white and pink bouquets hanging down from charcoal dark branches. Beautiful? Well yes. Magical, yes of course. It&#8217;s this combination of subtle beauty and magical appearance that has awed the generations over. And created this cult around cherry blossoms.</p>
<div id="attachment_858" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-858" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00002.jpg" alt="Party under lantern and cherry blossoms" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00002.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA00002-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Party under lantern and cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Life pauses during these two weeks. Droves head to nearby places under cherry blossoms for enjoying the view. And eat and drink. And drink. And eat. And it goes on till late evenings. On a moonlit night the white sponge of flowers appear like a bob of cloud hanging just above. Surreal enough to spawn tales of eternal love. When the same white bouquet is illuminated by rays of light from a lantern hanging in the patio &#8211; its magical. It&#8217;s this feeling that&#8217;s been given a name and celebrated as Yo Zakura. Evening sakura in literal translation. Transliteration would be something like enjoying the beauty of sakura against evening light. Whatever, meaning aside, it&#8217;s a party time.</p>
<div id="attachment_853" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-853" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA100001.jpg" alt="Food and drinks and yozakura" width="401" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA100001.jpg 401w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA100001-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/YOSAKURA100001-300x390.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Food and drinks and yozakura</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sakura viewing spots in Tokyo have traditionally arranged evening illumination for yozakura. The favorite viewing spots like Ueno Park, Sumida river Park, Meguro, Zojoji temple complex, Imperial palace compound  all light up with colorful traditional (looking) lanterns hung around. Shops spring up selling traditional food. Shopkeepers and municipality work to arrange tables and chairs in order under the illuminated trees, all numbered properly &#8211; the trees, the tables, the rows. Just so that group members reaching from around the city know precisely where to head to. Party food and drinks are all preset; just order a set and sit down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yozakura rolls on for 2 hours. Then gentle announcement reminds one and all its time to pack up, throw waste into clearly marked bins separating glass &#8211; plastic &#8211; tin cans, and head home. Lights switch off. Columns of merry crowd heads towards the nearby railway stations, still dazed, from the burst of celebration. And the same scene repeats the next evening for another evening till the two weeks pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the tourist rush during these two weeks, some municipalities set up multilingual booths to help tourists. Chiyoda ward publishes white-pink jacketed booklets to hand out to all who goes for Yosakura around the imperial palace gardens near Kudanshita station. In places lit by focus lamps the cherry blossom trees extend all the way onto the moat circling the palace. Boats moored into the water, resting under the cherry blossoms make for that perfect photo op. It&#8217;s all a fun experience, adding up to the celebratory mood all around. Hope you will like the photos.  For more information please follow this URL</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This 10th April was the annual spring open day at Edogawa Rowing Club.  Winter is gone. Colorful boats were floating gently in the spring breeze under the mellow sun. Viewers gathered around the river side in tents under the cherry blossom trees.</p>
<h2>Edogawa &#8211; center for Tokyo Water Sports</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Edogawa was a low lying area, riverine marshy land. In terms of industry there were log factories, boat building, fishing. Funabori railway station was a dock. Government revenue department had its customs checkpoint set up here. It&#8217;s a museum now.</p>
<div id="attachment_846" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-846 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-300x300.jpg" alt="Rowing under cherry blossoms" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200001.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rowing under cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Urbanization has changed much of this eastern fringe of old Tokyo. But some traditions lived on. Boating or its modern versions like rowing canoeing speed boating water scootering have taken the place. Aided by newly set up  lock gates and jetties the Kyu Nakagawa canal has transformed into a water sports enthusiasts training ground. School rowing and canoeing clubs set up tents on Sundays. So do the members of local rowing/canoeing clubs. Any body can be a member, age no bar. In fact the ever growing fitness craze among even longer living Japanese population sees a lot of grey haired men and women as members. Youngsters from the age of 12 (middle school/ Chu Gakkou ) can take to their own canoes. The school club members practice speed rowing in batches. Most club equipments such as boats / canoes / oars are kept in two storage areas under the two foot bridges connecting Komatsugawa and Ojima. Individual enthusiasts with their own row boats / inflatables  are also welcome. Cars with boats tugged behind or secured on top can park in a neighborhood car parking in Komatsugawa park.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Annual Spring Open Day &#8211; rowing under the cherry blossoms</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local clubs start their annual season every Spring. On a set day all clubs descend on to the area between the two bridges setting up tents, and information kiosks. New members are welcome to join. To help people experience the fun, the clubs offer free 30 minutes try it yourself offers. Each club has its own specialty. Some have row boats, some canoes, some rubber dinghies and others with wooden traditional ones. At one end competitions are held between club members. The competition boats are long traditional dragon boats with one yeoman playing a drum. The competitors in their team colors row their long boats in unison with the yeomans rhythm. Members friends and families cheer from under their tents by the river side.</p>
<div id="attachment_847" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-847" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-300x300.jpg" alt="Row boats and dragon boats for racing" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW200002.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Row boats and dragon boats for racing</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comparatively the introductory rides for new members bring in a different kind of excitement. Mainly crowded by just-attained middle school kids and their parents, it is a chance to test one&#8217;s abilities in water sports. Senior citizens with enthusiasm for new challenges also step in. Life vest, brief training, and assistance in water is provided by the club members.</p>
<div id="attachment_842" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-842" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004-300x230.jpg" alt="Learners queue up " width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/EDOROW00004.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Learners queue up</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event timing being in spring, cherry blossom trees in bloom greet day&#8217;s visitors. The cherry blossoms, the colorful tents, carbon fiber boats and the cheerful crowd make for a festive day atmosphere. Food carts with tako yaki, and kaki gori complete the ambiance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">Spring Cherry blossom festival at 1000 Sakura park Tokyo</h2>
<div id="attachment_835" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-835 size-full" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006.jpg" alt="Komatsugawa Sakura Matsuri" width="361" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006.jpg 361w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00006-300x433.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Komatsugawa Sakura Matsuri</p></div>
<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">In Japanese tradition Cherry blossoms represent rejuvenation. After the bitter cold winter comes spring holding the hands of Cherry blossom. When it arrives it covers the neighborhood with gorgeous bloom. Somewhat akin to the old saying that tough times don&#8217;t last forever. And when the good times finally come it showers a fortune on the believer. For the Japanese Shinto who worshiped nature as God, Cherry blossoms thus are a direct revelation of the mystique. It&#8217;s the same kind of association as is Christmas in Christianity or Passover in Judaism. It&#8217;s time to forget the mundane, get out enjoy the beauty of nature with friends and family. In fact viewing the cherry blossoms while having a feast is a tradition with a name &#8211; Hanami. In pockets where there are Cherry blossom trees the entire neighborhood comes out and celebrates, sometimes with song and dance.</p>
<div id="attachment_829" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-829 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00002-300x300.jpg" alt="Taiko play at Matsuri" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00002-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SENSAKURA00002.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Taiko play at Matsuri</p></div>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">The SenBonZakura that is 1000 Sakura park in the Ojima Komatsugawa area at the eastern fringe of Tokyo is one such area. Originally a low lying marsh land, this area was reclaimed and developed with green parks and planned neighborhood by the side of river Arakawa. As a symbol of this regeneration cherry blossom trees were planted in droves along the Arakawa river banks. In due time the trees grew into famed 1000 sakuras that shroud the neighborhood in the 1st week of April. A grand neighborhood celebration follows. Temporary food stalls are set up. Visitors pitch tents in variety of shapes and colors. Song and dances by neighborhood artists grace a temporary stage. Horseback riding, traditional drumming performances (Taiko) and various such other attractions add to the ambiance.</p>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">Kids joyful shrieks playing with their friends, with their doting parents and grandparents fill in the surroundings. Scent of incense sticks lit in the alter of the family deity permeates through. Ladies in gorgeous traditional kimonos arrange Tea Ceremony, if nothing but for keeping the tradition alive and educating the current generation.</p>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">Over the years the celebration has grown and turned into a local matsuri  (festival) of its own. Like other years this year&#8217;s celebration for year 2016 was gorgeous as well. Presented in photos here are glimpses of the festivities. To listen to the sounds of Taiko drums, Horagais (traditional horns made from conch shells) and to see excerpts of the live performances, follow the below YouTube link.</p>

<p class="normal" style="text-align: justify;">As they say life is ethereal and so are the cherry blossoms. The Japanese hold this association close to heart and tries to live every moment of the one or two weeks that the blossoms last. This article is just an effort to extend that feeling across to a wider audience, and make it last a little longer. Hope you enjoyed it.

<div id="attachment_809" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-809" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00002.jpg" alt="ZOJOJI select images" width="361" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00002.jpg 361w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00002-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00002-300x433.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ZOJOJI select images</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Origin of Zojoji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tokugaya shogun was the one most powerful samurai leader in whole of Japan. He was the real ruler, the chief of army. The reining monarch in Kyoto was monarch by title only. Shogun ruled from Edo, a region far away from the then capital Kyoto. Edo changed over the years into the modern city of Tokyo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shogun took up Buddhism. His estate set up the grand Zojoji temple complex. It was to be the presiding deity of Edo Tokyo, by whose alter the mighty Samurais took oath of knighthood. The last remains of the deceased lord and his family also rest here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is said that the temple originally was built more than 700 years ago. Then moved to current location by orders of Tokugaya shogun. At its peak it housed a huge monastery complex with 3000 monks living in the precincts. But much of that complex was burned down by allied bombing during the world war. The main gate, rising 21 meters up, is the remaining original wooden structure.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<div id="attachment_801" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-801" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00010-300x170.jpg" alt="Approach map of ZOJOJI " width="300" height="170" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00010-300x170.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00010.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Approach map of ZOJOJI</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zozoji is approachable from several metro stations &#8211; Akabanenashi on Oedo line, Kamiyacho on Hibiya line, Shiba Koen on Mita line. Also it is a short walk away from JR hamamatsucho station. The entire complex is on a well preserved wooded hill, with real estate development chipping away only on the Kamiyacho end.</p>
<div id="attachment_818" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-818" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00004.jpg" alt="ZOJOJI and Tokyo Tower" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00004.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00004-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00004-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ZOJOJI and Tokyo Tower</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Kamiyacho side at the top of the hillock, Tokyo tower was established in the sixties. A copy of Eiffel tower but higher, it is a telecommunication tower as well as a tourist site on its own. From Tokyo tower, the path descends down via a small wooded path towards Zojoji. If approaching from Akabanebashi station, then walk towards Tokyo tower that is visible right out of  the station and take a right as you approach the tower. Or, you can take a right turn crossing the 4-way crossing right outside Akabanebashi and walk by the outer walls of Tokyo Prince Tower hotel. The tree-covered road winds through a beautifully maintained open garden, crosses over a narrow stream with boulders strewn around, and opens into a wide courtyard adjacent to Zojoji.</p>
<div id="attachment_806" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-806" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00005.jpg" alt="ZOJOJI from Akabanebashi station" width="361" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00005.jpg 361w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00005-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00005-300x433.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ZOJOJI from Akabanebashi station</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small temple stands at the corner of the courtyard; you pass by it as you approach Zojoji. The landscape, the red wooden gates and the small temple all lend themselves to photography. If approaching From Shibakoen station though it is the closest walk;, the main entrance door being almost right across the station on the other side separated by a busy road.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walking around</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entering through the main gate one reaches the temple courtyard. Straight in front up several flight of stairs is the main building. There are valuables from yesteryear preserved in the downstairs museum. The tombs of shogun and his family rest at the burial ground behind this main building, locked behind heavy gilded bronze doors. On the right side of approach  to the main building is the bell tower. Next to the bell tower is a Tea ceremony room. To the right of the main building is the shrine dedicated to Black Amitabha Buddha, the protector of the shogun in many a battles. The way right of this shrine winds into a garden with smaller shrines. Footpath adjacent to the boundary wall leads to Tokyo tower. In this garden there are statues of baby Buddhas dedicated to the memory of unborn children. Grieving parents visit here to tend to the statues, offering flowers and incense.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A wooden board with threads running across have number of paper scrolls hanging from the threads &#8211; each one a prayer from someone for someone.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Walking over to the back side following the garden path one reaches the burial ground. Farther past, the path leads to monks quarters. The path turns back, ends at the wide arena surrounded by Zojoji administrative quarters, cultural complex and other buildings normally not accessible to common people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The temple premises are open twenty four hours, though the shrine doors close by evening 5:30 pm. Regular festivals are held in the premises as per annual calendar. Cultural shows like Noh dance under moonlight are a big draw.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Spring Cherry Blossom Festival</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During spring the temple complex area gets covered in cherry blossoms. On a designated day in the 1st week of April, an elaborate procession led by the Shrines high priest, followed by ornately dressed teams of dancers walk into the temple. Monks in a procession head towards the sanctum up the stairs, with assistants holding colorful umbrellas following closely. Gongs of Drums and bells announce the beginning of the occasion. In comes groups of representatives from different high ranking families and clans in their regalia. Audience on the two sides are allowed to take photos, and offer their prayers if one desired. The entire set of rituals are orchestrated in solemn religious manner, in the backdrop of lush pink and white cherry blossoms covering the horizon.</p>
<div id="attachment_808" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-808" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00003.jpg" alt="ZOJOJI Spring Fest images collection" width="681" height="469" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00003.jpg 681w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00003-300x207.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ZOJOJI00003-130x90.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ZOJOJI Spring Fest images collection</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the air of grandeur still evident at Zojoji, the post war changes in local cultural mores have dealt a subtle dent in the prominence originally enjoyed by this temple. Buddhism was shunned by the new government in favor of Shintoism. Meiji Jingu became the official guardian deity of Tokyo. But that has not dimmed the blessings accorded to Zojoji by nature every spring. Rather the dimming in its religious stature has perhaps been more than compensated by the recognition of Zojoji as one of the finest piece of heritage and beauty in this side of Japan. If you are in Tokyo for Cherry Blossoms, then Zojoji should be one the top 2 points to visit. The other being  Ueno Park, for details of which please follow this URL below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ueno Park Tokyo &#8211; hanami and the lily pond</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than a hundred and fifty years ago, a fierce battle was fought on the hill of Ueno. The battle ended the reign of Samurai shoguns and restored the power of Meiji emperor. A new chapter started in Japan&#8217;s history.</p>
<div id="attachment_757" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008-231x300.jpg" alt="History as a company" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00008.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">History as a company</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the beginning of the current Ueno park. A huge temple complex that stood around here was mostly destroyed in the battle. In its place came up a vast open park area, with a part housing a cache of arts, science and history museums and another part housing the first zoo in Tokyo.</p>
<div id="attachment_741" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-741" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010.jpg" alt="through the cherry blossoms" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00010-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">through the cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today Ueno park plays host to numerous festivals and is home to visitors from across Japan and abroad. With the Keisei line connection to Narita airport originating from here, it has naturally become a tourist activity center. Annual social festivals like Hanami the cherry blossom viewing-eating-drinking has been of the biggest festivals held in its premises. During the 7-10 days of cherry blossom season in April the park becomes colored with that of cherry blossoms, and of the lanterns hung in the evening, interspersed with the colors of the kimonos of joyous guests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The park is right next to Akihabara the electronics district of Tokyo. The area however still bears some characteristics of the historic era that it belonged to. Lately being a junction station for Tourists arriving from Narita international airport, it has been swept with touristy flavors to some extent. All mixed together, Ueno park has evolved into an eclectic mix.</p>
<div id="attachment_763" style="width: 258px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-763" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park-248x300.jpg" alt="Map of Ueno Park" width="248" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park-248x300.jpg 248w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park-300x364.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Map-of-Ueno-Park.jpg 373w" sizes="(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Map of Ueno Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main Approaching road is from Ameyokocho, the last standing bazaar district  of modern Tokyo. Get down from subway Ginza line / Hibiya Line Ueno station, or JR Yamanote line Ueno station. Cross the road over. And a moist breeze coming from the forested hills greets visitors. Granite stairs go up. Notice boards around declare the historic importance of this park. The road divides here, takes to two ways. One goes up, past the Kiyomizu Kannon temple and the Toshogu shrines in Crimson red. The other goes around the hill, and takes a turn towards the lake at the base of the hill.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hanami</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The road up by the wooden shrine complex winds its way through dense woods. In summer the canopy shades the weary. In spring the blossoms of Sakura hosts the Hanami crowd. For the few weeks of end March till early April this whole area turns into a party venue. Groups of people from all walks of the big city descend here, securing their own spot under the cherry trees. The sacred tradition of celebrating spring with family and friends  has over the years become an event on the calendar of the city bred. Business colleagues, ex-colleagues meet up and celebrate together hoping for a prosperous year ahead. As evening descends, lanterns hung from the trees light up the whole area in a yellow incandescence. Time passes on amidst cheers and laughter.</p>
<div id="attachment_760" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-760" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012.jpg" alt="Hanami in the evening" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00012-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanami in the evening</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path winds its way past statues of past leaders and opens into a wide boulevard. This area has a lot to offer to a variety of audience. Around the central row of fountains and several restaurants, Edifices of national importance such as the national science museum , national museum of art, international modern art museum and national library have been set up. Close to the national museum, a wooded zone harbors children&#8217;s play area and few restaurants. The buildings  in the boulevard border its three sides from right to left. The path ends at Ueno zoo at extreme left. Ueno zoo is the first and one of the best known zoos around. We shall talk more about the zoo and the museums in other articles. Let&#8217;s take our walk back to where we started the path up the hill.</p>
<div id="attachment_762" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-762" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00011-300x230.jpg" alt="National musuem" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00011-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00011.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">National musuem</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way around the hill goes towards the Ueno lake. It is divided into separate water bodies by criss crossing pedestrian walk ways. At the extreme end it merges into the lower tier of Ueno zoo. Visitors to the zoo get the best view of this part. Several enclosures of zoo inhabitants like the red beak flamingoes border the meandering lake. Restaurants set up benches by the waters. In Summer the lake gets filled up with giant water lilies. Varieties of migratory birds flock in, making this lily covered pond their home for the season.</p>
<div id="attachment_753" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-753" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007-231x300.jpg" alt="View from deck of Bentendo " width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00007.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View from deck of Bentendo</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next section of the lake, further away from zoo, weaves around a Buddhist temple the Bentendo at its center. Visited by both locals and tourists, it becomes crowded quickly during the afternoons on weekends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Essence from the burning incense sticks fills in the area. Food stalls selling chocolate covered stuff to fried squids line up the approach way to the shrine. A weeping cherry blossoms tree standing at a corner of the temple complex bends down with the weight of the flowers touching the water below. Ducks come swimming looking for food in the undergrowth. It&#8217;s a photographer&#8217;s delight.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Lily Pond</h2>
<div id="attachment_748" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-748" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002-208x300.jpg" alt="Shinobazu - the lily pond" width="208" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002-300x433.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00002.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Shinobazu &#8211; the lily pond</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path crossing onto the other side past the temple is hemmed on the two sides by water bodies. One side has wooden walkways, to let visitors venture into the depths, to see the colored fish swimming around. And to appreciate the lotus blossoms in summer as the flowers stir their heads up from under the giant leaves. This is a popular meeting area for city folks, known as Shinobazu pond.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cherry blossoms by the lakeside</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other side of the walkway is let for boating. Colored fiberglass boats in various shapes float around. Benches on the sides let people take in the view as long as they please. But the area fills in early with Hanami crowd during the cherry blossom season. Cherry blossom trees bordering the lake fill up the waters with a pink layer of petals. Couples in their traditional best take a break on the benches. Photographers get busy trying to take that one memorable shot. Sometimes a lonely musician finds his tune by the water under the cherry blossoms. The high chords of sax or the merry tunes of accordion sets an ambiance of its own.</p>
<div id="attachment_755" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-755" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003.jpg" alt="Boating lake turned pink by the cherry blossoms" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Boating lake turned pink by the cherry blossoms</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path heads back towards the busy Ameyokocho crossing. A cultural complex with artificial fountain on one side of its boundary wall tries to present another reason to stop once more. And appreciate the area around. The vast expanse of the lake, the cherry blossoms in spring, the lotus in summer, the vermilion red wooden Buddhist temple in the middle, the hill going up. The history, the culture, it&#8217;s memories. Foreign tunes sometimes float in, coming from the occasional hula dance sessions held at the cultural center. On other times, it&#8217;s mostly a quiet area, a break from the busy business district across the road at Ameyokocho and a little farther down where there is Akihabara, the neon lit electronics district.</p>
<div id="attachment_761" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-761" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00013.jpg" alt="Hanami get togethers" width="281" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00013.jpg 281w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/UENOPARK00013-162x300.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanami get togethers</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ueno park holds a special place in the fabric of this city. The history borne by the vestiges of Buddhist shrines, the gentrified cultural complexes, the lily filled water bodies, all come together to forge this identity. Take your time. Explore this area. You will perhaps come back more times than you originally planned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Its Winter! Lets go ice skating in Tokyo</h2>
<div id="attachment_683" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-683" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE100001-300x300.jpg" alt="Its winter! courtesy Freepik.com" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE100001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE100001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE100001.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Its winter! courtesy Freepik.com</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it&#8217;s cold outside, and windy, and you are alone at home, you can still enjoy the time. No I am not saying to lazily watch TV. You can actually go enjoy engaging in sports, right in the neighborhood. You don&#8217;t even have to be a member of any formal sports club. Don&#8217;t need to make any appointment. Don&#8217;t need any gears. Yes You can go walk into any of the ice skating rinks around in town. Just go Ice Skating in Tokyo. In Roppongi Midtown, or Akasaka Sakas, in Harajuku or such many places . There are both outdoor and indoor facilities. Some are permanent, open all year round. Some like the one in Akasaka open only during the winter season.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When people in colorful woolens glide across the ice white rink, Christmas music playing in the background, its like the Disney movies. Its hard not to join in, even if skating is not truly ones core skill. You can have trainers train you. And you need not even spend a fortune for it. Well, you may not even spend a penny, to be precise, provided you are at the right place at right time. There are city council run ice skating rinks in Tokyo that offer free training on selected days/time. Very friendly to beginners. Interested? Then read on.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Edogawa Sports Land</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One Sunday morning a couple of weeks back, we decided to go for skating. Newbies that we were, we went for a council run facility in Eastern fringe of Tokyo. Known as Edogawa sports land, it is on Toei Shinjuku subway line, easily reachable by short bus trip from Shinozaki or Mizue station. It is inside a new and expansive sports complex building. The rink converts into a swimming pool in summer and offers skating in winter. Buses are frequent. Get down, walk in, buy your ticket from the ticket vending machine, pick up your size shoes from the well stocked facility, go to the locker room, pick up a helmet if you so please at the entrance to the rink, and there you are &#8211; all set to skate. Easy as 1-2-3.</p>
<div id="attachment_676" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-676" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005-300x300.jpg" alt="We are skating yaay " width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00005.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We are skating yaay</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were people of all ages and skills trying their hand, err feet, in ice skating. Not surprisingly there were some nimble young belle skating with all the moves one sees on TV. Well well, if we had time on our side we also could do it. Its ice right? So just step in, and voila, you start sliding! That&#8217;s what we thought. Things were not that easy though, to be honest. Gravity seemed to have a particular liking for us, making us hit the ground time and again. Nevertheless, that&#8217;s part of the game. There was that old gentleman skating deftly past us effortlessly. Inspiration. Never give up, we told ourselves. There were indeed some folks with amazing skills, and there were newbies. Like us many people walked in, just to enjoy skating.</p>
<div id="attachment_679" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-679" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00002-300x230.jpg" alt="Glowing in joy" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00002-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/ICESKATE00002.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Glowing in joy</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got time to rest as a bell rang. A big roller moved in, to smoothen the ice. Rest was well deserved indeed, given the number of falls in a span of 30 or 40 minutes. But we were eager to jump right back in as the bell rang again. It&#8217;s as long as you want for one entry pass. Refreshment facilities were well thought of. One can have either lunch or snacks from the attached refreshment area. There were hot fried chips, sausages, smoking hot curry rice from the cafeteria. There was even a food vending machine by the side, that served ready hot ramen!  For someone picky however, who feels that in the cold surroundings cold food gels better, that is there too. We actually indulged in Belgian ice creams, during one of the breaks. Served again by vending machines standing by. And then had freshly brewed coffee in the next break! Overall the time was well-spent, thoroughly enjoyed. Whenever felt tad bit too cold, feeling like needing a break from skating, to let the frozen toes heal, headed into the heated rest area. Chilled a bit, mean soaked the heat, and then came back in to blaze a trail&#8230;.kind of.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Japan&#8217;s food and drinks are as much an experience as is Akihabara&#8217;s  Otaku or Kyoto&#8217;s zen.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Washoku</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Washoku in Japanese means true Japanese food. Talk about washoku, and you will have your Japanese friend turn nostalgic. Traditionally the main Japanese food is rice or noodles with toppings. Japanese rice is usually small grained and sticky, easy to grapple with chopsticks.  But that&#8217;s a coarse description. Washoku-ians would talk about those specific varieties of rice that grow in so and so prefecture. Rice is often served in a bowl covered with toppings. Toppings vary, a favorite  being raw egg. Along side the main dish, there&#8217;a a rich choice of side dishes. Side dishes could be fried in batter. Called &#8220;Tempura&#8221;. Or could be grilled and dipped in sauce. Heard of &#8220;Unagi&#8221;? Its Eel grilled and dipped in sauce; super delectable for the washoku patron. A soup comprising of tofu and/or green sea weeds (&#8220;nori&#8221;) usually accompany the main dish. Meal is finished with green tea, hot or cold.</p>
<div id="attachment_512" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-512" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002-210x300.jpg" alt="True Japanese food Washoku" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002-210x300.jpg 210w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002-300x430.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">True Japanese food Washoku</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rice is home food. Rolled into nice triangles with fillers is the quintessential &#8220;Onigiri&#8221; &#8211; the fulfilling lunch for the school boy. Noodles, are well a bit more formal, calls for more work to prepare it, and connotes an office goers lunch option kind of sense. Salarymen in Japan head for a quick bowl of noodles from favorite noodles shop. Depending on type of ingredient rice or wheat can be of several types Soba, Udon and Ramen. Udon topped with shredded roasted beef is &#8220;giu-udon&#8221;, a popular lunch item for the &#8220;salaryman&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_508" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-508" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004-300x250.jpg" alt="Onigiri" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004-300x250.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004.jpg 529w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Onigiri</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amongst side dishes, Fries called &#8220;Tempura&#8221;, could make use of any item one throws at it, kind of. Vegetarian? Try eggplant or gourd tempura. Others could try chicken nuggets, squid ring fries, and &#8220;you name it item fried&#8221;  tempura. Tempura are prepared like French fries deep fried dipped in a batter. When not fried, grilled or barbecued, the item is called Yaki&#8221;you name it item&#8221; for example yakitori is grilled chicken, a very popular food choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an island, local palate is also big on seafood. Sea food special restaurants go a long way to serve the bestest available to connoisseurs. For example  you can demand to know the origin of each mussel being served, before you so much as squeeze that lemon. Yes each one catch is individually marked with its place of origin, handwritten in Kanji on a chip of wood, to satisfy the connoisseur. Fresh sea food delicately sliced and tastefully served is what makes a special Japanese meal. But in non-special ordinary meal as well, you can expect fresh fish served right to you before you can even utter Fish. Fresh sliced fish is a culinary variety of its own &#8211; named &#8220;Sashimi&#8221;. And when the individual pieces of fish are wrapped around a mound of rice served neatly arranged in an exquisitely designed platter, it&#8217;s &#8220;Sushi&#8221;. The emphasis is on fresh, pure, and low fat. Variety is there even within the sashimi or sushi  dishes in the form of tuna, Mackerel, octopus, squid, sea urchins, crab meat, prawns etc. To generalize, Fish and rice makes the ever popular &#8220;mamas own&#8221; dish, can be taken for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner.</p>
<div id="attachment_507" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-507" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003-224x300.jpg" alt="Sushi" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003-224x300.jpg 224w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003-300x402.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sushi</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now as any self-respecting Michelin-star chef would let you know, food when taken fresh in its natural environs of origin, has a different taste. Japan is big on regional food. Rice from Miyagi prefecture is Pearl rice, such shining such special it is. You have to visit Miyagi prefecture to get that fresh shiny rice. Similarly Mussels from the north have that flavor oh so delicious. Beef from south especially Kobe beef has its own brand identity, protected with pride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not just regions but seasons have their own sway for Japanese palate. Fall colors bring in the catch of silvery Sanma fish. If walking in the park or river side while taking in the fall colors you get a waft of barbecue, its likely to be Sanma. Barbecue is very popular, and so is Sanma. Similarly after the rains, its mushroom time. Mushrooms of all colors sizes textures show up in dishes but the special one, comparable in prestige to  French black truffles, is Shitake mushroom. You can not go wrong if serving shitake to your Japanese guests.</p>
<div id="attachment_510" style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-510" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006-252x300.jpg" alt="Natto" width="252" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006-252x300.jpg 252w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006-300x357.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006.jpg 371w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Natto</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A discussion about Washoku can go on and on, the choices are rich and varied. Some items though stand apart meriting a mention on their own. For example&#8221;Natto&#8221;. In its simplest form its pure fermented soybean. Valued due to its nutritional value, known due to its rather challenging smell. Adventurous tourists include natto into their &#8220;lets try it&#8221; list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of the taste of the food items, Japanese overwhelmingly prefer food dipped in soy sauce, and vinegar. Mayonnaise is a recent entrant to go with tempura. But tomato sauce still tastes ahem foreign. Japanese curry is a more recent innovation, drawn from Indian variety, and is getting quite popular. But if you are one who likes the delicate natural taste with just a punch of twang, without all the spice of a curry, you can add Wasabi. It is like mustard but is actually derived from plant root. Just like chilies of certain fame, wasabi also can bite so readers beware. Next, sweet, as a taste is tolerated, not exactly cherished. Sweets in the form of bean paste rolled inside a thin layer of gelatinous rice or wheat is popular as a candy . People buy these sweets as memento from a distant place visited. Sour taste is mostly had in fruits, and fruit flavored drinks and candies, nowhere else. Bitter as a taste is conspicuously absent. Its place is taken by a taste called Umami, a Japanese taste now recognized as one of the primary tastes apart from sweet sour bitter salty. Its difficult to explain unless you have tasted it. If you have done, then please help explain for readers here&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Modernization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else food preferences change, new ingredients come up, or just new tastes develop. Japanese food habits are no exception. Lets take for example, in this fast fast world, you did not have the time to lick your lovingly prepared dish to the end. Do you throw the left over? Nope, not in Japan. &#8220;Mottai Nai&#8221; waste not is taught to children from early childhood. So necessity for reuse in small family fast life has given rise to a new food &#8211; Okonomiyaki. Left overs from &#8220;preloved&#8221; food sauted and fried together into a pancake is the new food okonomiyaki. Witnesses abound who swear its taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talking about modernization in food, food technology, food storage, one can talk perhaps endlessly. But the really path-breaking breakthrough came through instant noodles. It came in a giant leap, not in just a small step, if you know what I mean. Say yyou have a project to submit, no time to cook, not enough money to buy a good one. Grab a cup full of instant noodles. The sheer varieties ensure its quite likely that the cup is having all ingredients of your choice added. Just open the tap, add hot water and stir for a few blips on the clock. Your supper is ready. Just like toast and baked beans in the hostels of Western Hemisphere, this item has sustained several generations of student population in Asia. Nissin invented instant noodles. It became a legend. It is not just a company that makes &#8220;fast food&#8221; it touches an emotional chord amongst the Japanese youth.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ushoku</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">International food, distinctly non-Japanese, is what is called Ushoku &#8211; literally meaning imported food. Italian pasta ingredients are widely available, as are Indian curry spices. Bread and butter may not be quite that &#8220;bread and butter&#8221; amongst daily food choices but increasing consumption has caused shortfalls lately in the market resulting even in rationing of butter and cheese! All said though, except for dedicated Establishment selling imported European stuff, the quality or the variety of cheese and bread available at your neighborhood may leave you underwhelmed. Milk products generally are available with various degrees of fat, but the general availability being on the side of the less the better, you may not find your favorite thick creamy yogurt around. But you can double on milk extracted from soya bean. As for cheese, Tofu the cheese made from Soybean is by far dominating the foreign ones. Do not assume though that you may have to substitute your mozzarella toppings with tofu, no. You can order you pizza or pasta as you would anywhere elsewhere.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Fruits and vegetables</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fruits though expensive are available aplenty. Apples and cherries are also grown locally apart from importing. Some grapes are also grown in areas around Mt Fuji, mostly in wineries. Strawberries are also a popular produce. Strawberry picking is an annual event encouraging more people to participate in the farm activity. Round pears called Nashi are a seasonal favorite. Kaki A juicy fleshy fruit looking like square shaped tomato deserves special mention for its taste and flavor. Peaches and Plums are a revered traditional local fruit produce, exclusively used for producing fruit liquor. Fruits occupy a special place in Japanese psyche, as a delicacy, as a source of prized alcoholic beverages.  But the love for fruits have stepped out of the reigns of home into corporate culture. For the Japanese corporate nothing beats an executive gift like the perfectly round melon. The very best produce is often auctioned and presented as gifts to corporate top shots or political bigwigs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the vegetables department, choices are however somewhat short.  Most being of the root types. Mushrooms will delight mushroom aficionados. Shiitake mushrooms are particularly prized for its taste and nutritional value. Daily Green vegetable need in balanced diet is provided by seaweed called nori. Eggplant, spinach are the other few types of vegetables commonly available, but often with an uncommon or uncomfortable price!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Desserts</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the word desserts brings an image of a dollop of chocolate,  you will certainly not be disappointed. Chocolate covered this chocolate covered that, this dipped in chocolate, that rolled into chocolate are all there. And there is ice creams. But these are mostly later day imports. Talking about true Japanese there is a variant of ice cream made of crushed ice and syrup, called kaki gori, that you will come across in Summer. Its a ritual to have kaki gori, as a dessert, or simply as a way to enjoy a day out in summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_516" style="width: 297px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-516" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008-287x300.jpg" alt="Birthday dessert treat" width="287" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008-287x300.jpg 287w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008-300x314.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008.jpg 422w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Birthday dessert treat</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Children queue up outside the kaki gori stall. If you are thinking of tasting kaki gori, then try tea flavor. Green tea flavor is indeed a very popular flavor that is available in candies chocolates cakes ice creams.. Other desserts of local origin mostly trace their inheritance to either Tofu or bean paste. For more French Italian type of dessert, you may have to look for expat frequented neighborhoods such as Shibuya /Daikaniyama etc in Tokyo.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Beverages</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far we have talked only about food, not a drop to drink! Despair not. Japanese drinks are just as rich in variety as Japanese food. The most well known Japanese alcoholic drink is Sake. Distilled from rice, the colorless spirit taken warm or on ice is available in innumerable regional varieties. Good Sake is revered as it should be! It is given as offering to God; is part of all family as well as communal gettogethers.  Shochu is another variety of liquor some say distinct from sake due to the ingredients some others say due to the method of processing. Expert opinions aside, shochu is made from variety of sources such as root potato, plum, barley etc. Seasonal varieties are prized, as well advertised, such as cherry blossom liquor during spring season, plum liquor during summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_505" style="width: 286px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-505" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001-276x300.jpg" alt="Veg food served in style" width="276" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001-276x300.jpg 276w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001-300x327.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Veg food served in style</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lately beer has become the more popular drink especially for a light-hearted meetup after office hours. Wine and whiskey are also on the upsurge. Especially champagne has touched a stature of class amongst the nouveau rich. It has forced the traditional local distillers to innovate and come up with bubbly sake. Did you know A very typical side dish to go with alcoholic drinks is green peas called Mame!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But in so far as beverages are concerned, nothing is anything like tea. Hot or cold, before during or after a meal, tea is a must. Tea is as much a Japanese tradition, as much a part of life as is sushi or Mt Fuji  The ideal lady was supposed to know the art of serving tea. Rich and famous had an outhouse dedicated for tea ceremony. While that is all tradition, and seeped in history, the common person does not go any less in devouring this beverage in every occasion. Tea is supposedly good for blood cleaning, energizing, even for reducing fat. You wanna hear more ? Aha, you must be thinking, that is all nice etc but what do You do Mr tourist when you  wake up in the morning. What about coffee? If you were thinking  it, do not worry coffee culture is spreading, with Starbucks taking the lead in the big city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But if you would like to know where to taste the dishes, indulge or experiment, drink your favorite tipple  or the cuppa, then search for the article on Japanese restaurants, eateries and food-joints. As for this article iff you would like to add more information or correct any, please drop your comment. We are listening. And yes do not hesitate to share, we appreciate ideas and social exchange. Till then, cheers</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">People in Venice traveled in gondolas. Nordic people on reindeer sledges. On horse backs in the vast steppes of Asia and the Americas. In those days life moved at a slower pace, in tune with individual needs. Discovery of automotive brought in a big change. Horse drawn carriages gave in to motor cars, boats were replaced by &#8211; motor boats. That was the norm for quite some time; till the need came up to transport more people, faster than before, farther than before. Mass transit ways on rail was set up to rush the teeming millions to their place of work in time from places afar.</p>
<div id="attachment_471" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Greater-Tokyo-Area.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-471" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Greater-Tokyo-Area-300x264.jpg" alt="Tokyo compared to London - source https://twitter.com/Amazing_Maps" width="300" height="264" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Greater-Tokyo-Area-300x264.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Greater-Tokyo-Area.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tokyo compared to London &#8211; source <a href="https://twitter.com/Amazing_Maps" target="_blank">@Amazing_Maps</a></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As cities grew rail transport network became more complex. For Tokyo in particular, rails crisscross across the lengths and breadth of the city areas, both above and under the ground. Rail transport literally holds the key to its city life. The options are confusing at times. In this post lets look at the options available to you first as tourist and  second as local resident.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Options connecting tourist points</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assuming you already know your options as to how to travel from airport or have actually reached into the city from Narita or Haneda airport and moved into a place of stay. If not, then if you like to go through the posts <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/tokyo-travel-from-airport-to-city-proper/" target="_blank">from airport to city</a> and <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/tokyo-hotels-and-short-term-accommodations/" target="_blank">hotels and other short term accommodations</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within Tokyo city proper, subway &#8220;metro&#8221; is the primary means of transport. City transportation has been planned around the metro network.</p>
<div id="attachment_481" style="width: 191px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00004.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-481" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00004-181x300.jpg" alt="Tokyo Taxi Apps" width="181" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00004-181x300.jpg 181w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00004.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tokyo Taxi Apps</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buses ply from station to station covering the innards. Taxi cabs of course are available, can be availed of from taxi stands outside each station or can be hailed from anywhere on road. No need to say taxis are quite expensive. There are two major taxi companies that have English assistance and facilities for advanced booking &#8211; <a href="http://Www.nihon-kotsu.co.jp" target="_blank">Nihon Kotsu</a> and <a href="http://www.tokyomk.com/en/index.html" target="_blank">MK Taxi</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you know Japanese or got a local friend by you then however you have much more options. You can download and use Apps to hail the nearest taxi from your position, and/or book for a specific date/time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For most tourists though, trains will be the main means of transport. The <a href="http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/" target="_blank">Metro</a> trains run from morning 5am till midnight. Avoid the rush hour of 8am-9am in the morning and 5-6 pm in the evening if you can. Also the late night trains tend to be full with office-goers returning home after the almost mandatory after-office socializing. However if anyhow you find yourself stuck behind crowd while your station is reached remember to utter the magic work &#8220;Sumimasen&#8221;, the crowd will melt letting a way out for you. For women travelers there are designated compartments during the office rush hours. Otherwise the clean cool efficient subway will never fail you in reaching you your destination in time wherever it may be. Before stepping out lookup the Maps online. Or use google maps to find out the best connection from point A to B at a given time. Ticket options range from Day discount, train and bus combo discount etc. Also you can buy a magnetic/ chip based swipe card (called PASMO) in place of paper tickets. Its a prepaid card, available from ticket vending machines next to all most all metro stations and also from &#8220;combinis&#8221; around major stations. The advantage is you don&#8217;t have to look for change every time you get in or out of trains. The pass can also be used conveniently in buses, in JR rails (see below) and also in combinis and vending machines on platform. Some times if you are not sure about the fare or best route from point A to B you can choose to buy the minimum fare and adjust it before stepping out of the exit gate. In between you can transfer lines. With pass all adjustment etc are taken care of. Note that though, buying a pasmo does not get you any discount per se.</p>
<div id="attachment_485" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-Metro-Map.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-485" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-Metro-Map-300x212.jpg" alt="Tokyo Metro Map" width="300" height="212" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-Metro-Map-300x212.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-Metro-Map.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tokyo Metro Map</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arrangements are being added to make metro transport friendly to the disadvantaged, physically and/or language wise. Lifts and escalators, washrooms for the physically challenged, reserved seating at either end of each compartment are standard facilities. For the visually impaired there are patterns on the platform floor to guide during walk, while chirping bird sounds indicate a staircase or escalator going up or down shortly ahead. Maps at each station also point out the compartment closest to exit at any given station. English guide maps on platform show your location vis a vis the nearest escalator/elevator/connecting line platform. In places where tourists frequent local station assistants,  given their language handicap, try to post visual answers to most common questions (see pic.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From metro you can connect to buses  <a href="http://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/eng/" target="_blank">http://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/eng/</a> at major stations. Buses cover the hinter land not served adequately by the criss-crossing subway lines. Subway train stations have names as well as numbers combining the line name initial followed by station number. Once can easily decipher subway route and plan journey from available information. Whereas personally I find buses are little difficult to handle as the bus names start with place name abbreviation followed by a number. Challenge lies in deciphering the place name which is often written in Kanji script, the pictorial script tracing its origin to China. On top of that there&#8217;s the loop puzzle where two buses evidently having same number run in opposite directions crossing at a loop. On the positive side you can always ask the driver who will try his best to help. So even though as each stop approaches the electronic board above the driver shows your stop, he will take care to flag your destination has arrived. In any case buses and trains have free wifi you can register at from your hotel.  So you will always have the assistance from our friend <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps" target="_blank">Google</a> that will be able to show your position moving through the map. City Bus fares are same whether you go 1 stop or the entire route. Everywhere elementary school children pay half whereas younger ones travel gratis. Same rule applies for train ticket fares. Unlike some other cities around the world, in Tokyo buses you don&#8217;t have to worry about carrying the right change, as the payment turnstile next to driver issues change. Once you get the change insert into the payment slot and walk out past the driver. Apart from local commuter buses, there are the hop on hop off buses especially for tourists, operated by likes of <a href="http://www.skybus.jp/hop_asa.php?lang=en">Sky bus</a> and <a href="http://www.hatobus.com/en/index.html">Hato bus</a>. You get pretty much the standard fare like multilingual support half day tour full day tour etc. Check the links for more information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the travails through the city especially if you are new to the country and can not read write or understand, it is not unusual to miss your stop or get onto a different bus/train. But Even if you are lost rest assured of assistance to the best of ones ability from anybody around. In case you left your belongings in train or bus or taxi worry not you will get it back. In train station there are dedicated assistants who will collect items left by passengers and help in returning back to owner.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Options for residents</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We discussed at length about Metro, bus and taxis but have not spoken so far about <a href="http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/">JR (Japan Railway)</a>. To move inside Tokyo as a tourist, you are not likely to use JR lines much save for the one Yamanote line. Yamanote line weaves through in a circular route touching some of the major business and tourist areas around, thus being very popular with foreigners. Being circular you are never too far even if you are lost or missed your destination. And in a day pass you can &#8220;cover&#8221; several points of interest. Conveniently connecting at major stations with subway metro, touching by shopping centers/office areas/tourist sites, Yamanote line itself is a tourist &#8220;goto&#8221; item, exaggeration admitted.</p>
<div id="attachment_484" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Yamanote-line.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-484" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Yamanote-line-300x172.jpg" alt="Yamanote line" width="300" height="172" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Yamanote-line-300x172.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Yamanote-line.jpg 941w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yamanote line</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But apart from Yamanote line, mostly JR lines travel in North/West/South direction away from the city into its suburbs. Office time rush sees the millions coming into the city traveling by JR.  So JR have no option but to recruit those famed official Pushers in white gloves, helping push the tightly packed compartments doors to close.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to metro, JR maps on each platform clearly show the closest elevator / escalator, exit to a specific landmark, and gates where you can change to a different line with distance in Meters mentioned from where you are at. Often next to the location guide the train timetable lists trains on the two sides of the platform. On each side of the board the station lists are marked in light and dark shades respectively, for the stations past and the ones due next. Take care to note different express semi-express local train lines indicated by separate colors  and the stations where these ones stop or skip. The boards are highly helpful but gets complicated at major stations like Shinjuku Otemachi Shibuya. Platforms underground or overground can run into multi-storied maze spanning 6 levels or more. You may have to walk for upto a kilometer to reach your designated line and entry gate. And added to that, some lines change name from a given station. Further, some trains may stop at certain stations during certain times of the day and skip at other times. If you are OK so far, then the next challenge is in deciphering the railway operator. JR lines are operated by private operators at certain routes, either exclusively or in parallel with JR. So for example if you are travelling between Tokyo and Odawara, a suburb 60 minutes by train, you have to decide whether to take JR or Odakyu, one of the private operators.  Similarly in other zones there are other private operators like Keisei, Keio, Seibu, Tobu etc. Platforms can be separate  or same.</p>
<div id="attachment_486" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-486" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00001-232x300.jpg" alt="Tokyo route finder" width="232" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00001-232x300.jpg 232w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00001.jpg 341w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tokyo route finder</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Thus the JR lines can challenge you first time visitors, given the sheer number of trains arriving and leaving heading to various directions. By the same coin, it is a boon for residents adding to options end of a long day. Lately Japan government is trying hard to make finding transportation more convenient for people, through installation of online kiosks. So even if you are not online / do not have the Google maps transit path, you may not be all lost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally speaking, even though rail stations and the trains are busy and crowded, the overall ambiance is of quietude as travel courtesy demands no talking or loud noise in train or platform. Most passengers immerse themselves in mobile games/social network sites or shopping while a few more traditional ones may browse through paper books. Mobile phones stay in silent vibration mode known locally as courtesy mode. The announcements by the platform assistant and guards ring through mentioning about trains arriving or the next station or reminding passengers to be mindful of the gap between the train and the platform. Infact some of the phrases picked up by foreigners are these very predictable standard announcements such as &#8220;Densha to home to Aida ni Aite orimas no de gochuui kudasai&#8221; &#8211; be careful of the gap between train and the platform! If you are traveling for a few days in the city, the predictability and timeliness of Tokyo rail transit comes to stay with you. You may be forgiven for forgetting it is not always the same everywhere around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for traveling outside the city, apart from trains buses are also getting popular these days. Leaving from major stations like Shinjuku or Ikebukro, long distance overnight buses operated by JR, <a href="http://willerexpress.com/en/">Willer Express</a> offer low fare option to go visit distant places such as Kyoto or Nagano. For details on out of Tokyo transport please refer to same named page in this site.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other less of an options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have not talked about bicycles, that manual two wheeled mode of transport have we? Well had this been somewhere in some European city it would not have to come at the last. But in Tokyo cycles are conspicuously absent as means of transport for the &#8220;serious&#8221; traveler. It is not for office goers, to come straight to the point. But that does not mean Tokyo does not have a cycle culture. It does, for the students and the mamas dropping their kids to day cares.  &#8220;Mamachari&#8221; is a category of cycles with front and back seats with harnesses to seat the tiny tots comfortably while they are half asleep on the way to care center or back.</p>
<div id="attachment_483" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/RentaBike.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-483" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/RentaBike-300x262.jpg" alt="Tokyo Rent a Bike" width="300" height="262" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/RentaBike-300x262.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/RentaBike.jpg 591w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tokyo Rent a Bike</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cycles are also available in some areas for leisure travel, but to a large extent it is absent from tourist options. Attempts are being made though to address this gap. Recently a scheme for <a href="http://docomo-cycle.jp/minato/en/">sharing bicycles</a> has been launched, with options for booking online in cooperation with NTT Docomo. It is yet to be seen though as to how popular this turns out to be.</p>
<div id="attachment_487" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-487" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00002-300x230.jpg" alt="Veloride" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00002-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00002.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Veloride</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a step up though, fancy trying tricycles, chauffeur driven ones? If you do then there are some options around in the city, specifically aimed as one time experience though. You can ride a traditional hand pulled rickshaw near tourist favorite temples like Asakusa. And in some more hip joints you can try the modern incarnation the &#8220;velorides&#8221; (see pic.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is another mode of transport the Water transport that we did not mention so far.</p>
<div id="attachment_482" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-waterways.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-482" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-waterways-300x258.jpg" alt="Tokyo waterways" width="300" height="258" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-waterways-300x258.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo-waterways.jpg 712w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tokyo waterways</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also a distant runner up when it comes to transporting the majority.</p>
<div id="attachment_488" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00003.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00003-300x230.jpg" alt="Sky duck bus" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00003-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TYOTRANS00003.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sky duck bus</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is still largely a tourist facility like the duck bus around Tokyo Sky tree, or sort of an also ran option connecting two points such as Tokyo Odaiba sea side area with neighboring Yokohama harbor. River transport as an alternative does not quite exist, so to speak, save the one from Asakusa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, daily drive down to office is not an option for most, even if owning a car, due to the convenience offered by public transport on one hand and the punishing cost of parking in the city, on the other.  Besides the express highways in and out of the city center  tend to get pretty crowded on week days. Reason for executives staying in expansive suburban residences  to prefer traveling down by the expensive Shinkansens, the bullet train!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope reading this far you have had a fairly good idea about your travel options, should you come to town anytime soon. Do not hesitate to leave you comments, if you like the post. Clicking a &#8220;like&#8221; in your social network will help your friends, not to mention team Couchflyer:-) Enjoy your visit and take care&#8230;</p>
