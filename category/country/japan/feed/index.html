<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nijo castle was the residence of the Shogun in Kyoto, T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his was the place that united the land once divided into numerous fiefdoms into one country that is Nihon -Japan. </span></p>
<h3>The Singing Nightingale</h3>
<p>Japan was formally ruled by the emperor but power was concentrated in the hands of his .military general -the Shogun. Shogun set up his own administrative center in Nijo castle. Its where the he held his court. No wonder it was built to be secure as a fort with measures that included a surrounding moat and an outer and an inner perimeter fence. But the most unique feature of this castle was the state of the art defensive measure -the &#8220;singing platform&#8221;. Any potential assassin trying to tip-toe in would be detected as soon as he stepped on the floor as the floor would &#8220;sing&#8221;. This was a unique mechanism as ingenious in its engineering as scary in its message about the days political struggles.</p>

<h3>Emperor, Shogun and the Ninjas</h3>
<p>Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu was the first Shogun to have established himself as the supreme power in Japan. It was a time Japan was going through intense power struggle. Warlords fought for regional suzerainty. Hired assassins -the famed  Ninja&#8217;s &#8211; appeared in Japan&#8217;s history.  Known for their training in stealthy war craft Ninja&#8217;s were the greatest threat to Samurai lords. Nijo castle was built at this time, with this specific threat in mind. Inside the moat beyond the two perimeter walls, the inner quarters were built to alert the guards even if someone tried to tip toe on the floor. Erected from two separate layers with a series of metal spikes hanging in between , the floor would clank even under the gentlest push. This was the famous singing floor, a feat of engineering that survived through the ravages of time.</p>

<h3>The Nijo Mae</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The station next to Nijo castle is called Nijo Mae. &#8220;Mae&#8221; in Japanese means &#8220;in front&#8221;. So the easiest way to reach Nijo castle was to head to Nijo Mae station. Easy peasy, we thought. Unfortunately there are multiple surface,regional and subway lines leaving from Kyoto main railway station. Directions boards are there, but scant in number as compared to the number of lines and tourists. Moreover the entrance to the subway is a shoppers paradise. So if not careful one can get lost,like we did. Nijo showed up ts defenses even before we could approach!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In underground Google maps stopped working.. Shuffling through guidebooks, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fumbling for the right word, taking to dumb charades &#8211; did all that to finally find our way to Nijo Mae.</span></p>
<h3>Students with Notebooks</h3>
<div id="attachment_1326" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1326" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-300x300.jpg" alt="Way to the Tea Room" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310215633006-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to the Tea Room</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approached Nijo a further surprise awaited us. It was a school day. There were a bunch of kids in yellow caps at the crossing. As soon as the signal turned green a cockle of excited voices accompanied us to the entrance of the castle. A school excursion &#8211; explained one of the more curious kid eager to practise his English. It was to be the first of a series of interactions that day with the otherwise reticent bunch of Japanese schoolkids. It soon transpired that the kids were tasked to record visitor remarks also in their worksheets. In English. And this entire exercise was meant to make them less shy and more confident in dealing with foreigners! Japan was getting ready for Olympic 2020.  </span></p>
<h3>Castle Quarters and the Courtyards</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The castle entrance was via a bridge over a moat that surrounded the high walls. The gigantic doors opened into a wide lobby, guarded by towers. Attackers even if crossed the moat and made a successful entry would be pinned in this place by sharp shooters . Another layer of wall at its end secured the inner quarters. This is where the shogun set up his council.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1333" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1333 size-large" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Intricate carvings on wood and gold leaf" width="660" height="660" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310213155993-1250x1250.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Intricate carvings on wood and gold leaf</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors from afar, the local land lords, the lower generals, the informers, the agents each had their separate visitor room inside the elaborately decorated wooden palace. Each room had its designated seating areas with the lord being seated guarded by body guards. The rooms were exquisitely decorated. There were real gold embossed paintings of cranes in lily pond or flying high amongst the clouds. The entire building comprising of visitor rooms private rooms store rooms was constructed in a rectangular fashion, with a central courtyard opening into a lily pond. </span></p>
<h3>Palace Gardens</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the functional purpose of administrative head office, Nijo castle was also a show piece, a platform to demonstrate aristocratic finesse that only the shogun could summon. A court yard from behind the living quarters opened in to Japanese garden, with its flowing stream, and stone bridges. Walkways lined by maples and cedars meandered around the castle, During autumn, fall colors painted the area in red and yellow. A tea room at a corner at the far end, under the shadow of old cedar trees, offered a feel of peace and tranquility. Couples in Kimono walked by. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stepped path from here went up towards a terrace. The entire greater Kyoto with its blue tinged mountain ranges came into view from there.</span></p>
<h3>The Quintessential Japanese</h3>
<div id="attachment_1331" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1331 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-300x300.jpg" alt="The stone bridge over to the Japanese garden" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310212358846-1250x1250.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The stone bridge over to the Japanese garden</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1332" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1332" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-300x300.jpg" alt="Maples in garden" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024-768x768.jpg 768w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/pixlr_20180310220121385-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Maples in garden</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This embrace of nature, this surrender to  the ephemeral and eternal contrasts sharply with the identity of Nijo, as the war lords lair. This combination of power and renunciation is what defined the Shogun era Japanese psyche. Its the one common thread that runs through the defensive fabrication of the fortress, to the intricate gold leaf drawings on palace walls,  And this contrast captured in its highest form in Nijo distinguishes it as a World Heritage Site. Yes its a must visit site.     </span></p>

<h2>Fushimi Inari</h2>
<ul>
<li>15 minutes by JR NARA line from Kyoto</li>
<li>Shrine of Hollywood fame</li>
<li>Series of red Torii or wooden gates are its main attraction</li>

<p>From Tofukuji the next station is Fushimi Inari. We started from Kyoto station. Stopped at Tofukuji. Got back into the next available train in the same direction for the next stop at Fushimi. Could we have walked ? Cycled perhaps. But the journey in the small toy train like train itself was also fun.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you cross the road, a wide paved path leads the way through huge red wooden gate. This red vermilion colored Torii is what distinguishes the Fushimi Inari from others around. FushimiInari is known for Torii. It is not just for this one but  for the hundreds that follow. The path leads to the pavilion of the main temple complex. Then moves uphill.</p>

<p>It was originally an obeisance to the foxes that protected the harvest from small pests. But faith outgrew its genesis transforming into a tradition serving a larger purpose. The legend of Fushimi Inari was born.</p>
<p>Link to official website <a href="http://inari.jp/en/">Official website</a></p>
<h2>The Shrine of Hollywood Fame</h2>
<p>Unlike Tofukuji Fushimi Inari is a busier stop. Tofukuji retains quaint Japanese temple town characters. But Fushimi Inari is a tourist magnet, well known as the location  for Hollywood movie Memoirs of a Geisha. The station as a result enjoys better documentation in English.</p>
<p>Inari temples however abound in Japan, even in Tokyo. <a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/fox-god-inari-and-the-environment/">https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/fox-god-inari-and-the-environment/</a></p>
<p>So does Toriies in many Shinto shrines. Its of course the most famous Inari temple made famous by its association with Hollywood. Not otherwise nearly as pretty as compared to the richly decored Kinkakuji or blessed with fall colours such as Tofukuji. So unless trying to tick a destination off your list there is a chance one may feel underwhelmed! Beauty after all lies in the eyes of the beholder&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Celebrating Spring cherry blossoms in Japan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Petals fall. Float on the water beneath. A pink tinge covers the blue sky reflecting on the water. The pink cover shimmers, in the gentle breeze. It is spring, season of Sakura, the cherry blossom in Japan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the winter bids farewell, the blossoms usher in spring. Starting from the islands down south, spring gradually moves north over a few months, coloring the land pink as it moves. After the bitter cold months of winter in Japan, the arrival of spring is greeted with joy and gratitude. People across the nation celebrate Hanami &#8211; get togethers under the cherry trees to appreciate the beauty of nature, to exchange pleasantries. Food and drinks, chatter and laughter fill in the air. Families, friends, business colleagues arrange their Hanami parties. A carnival like joy d’ vivre fills in the ambience. Flocks of people in their best kimonos and yukata crowd the neighborhood spaces. Of Course never flouting the norms, never violating the boundaries of discipline. The cause must never be subjugated to the effect. It&#8217;s a celebration of nature, the bounties afforded to us by the supreme power. So the celebrations must obey, and pay due respect to his wishes. Prayers, waft of essence and the sound of the bell ring in from the temples.</p>
<div id="attachment_720" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-720" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00005.jpg" alt="Hanami celebrations in lantern light" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00005.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00005-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00005-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanami celebrations in lantern light</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But like all things in life, cherry blossoms too are a transient phenomenon. Here today, gone tomorrow leaving a cache of happy memories. The flowers bloom overnight, suddenly filling the barren branches with a trove of flowers. Then leave similarly one night, after the first light drizzle soaks the earth. This coming and going has not escaped the minds of the wise men of yore. Poets from the olden days when the capital was still in Nara, prior to Kyoto, wrote Haikus paying obeisance to this transient beauty of Sakura. A Haiku, in its brevity, innately resonates with the essence of Sakura &#8211; light pink, delicate, understated. Less told, more implied, most felt.</p>
<p>Haiku on Sakura (Source courtesy <a href="http://haikuguy.com/issa/search.php?keywords=cherry+blossom" target="_blank">Issa Archive</a>)</p>
<p>花さくやとある木陰も開帳仏</p>
<p>cherry blossoms&#8211;<br />
under every tree<br />

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Spring around Tokyo</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the rest of Japan Tokyo too, the big city of teeming millions, kind of gives in to the charm. Famous Sakura viewing spots, such as Ueno park, Shinjuku Goen, Meguro river sides become crowded. Evenings are spent with near and dear one under the cherry trees incandescent in the yellow glow of hanging lanterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you read the poem by William Wordsworth that eulogized daffodils as the harbingers of spring? In a scenario not too far removed from the isles of England, the blossoming of Sakura in Japan is as much a cherished moment. The country follows the progress of weather front on TV and the web.</p>
<div id="attachment_732" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-732" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA200001-300x159.jpg" alt="The Sakura Front source courtesy http://sakura.weathermap.jp/" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA200001-300x159.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA200001-390x205.jpg 390w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA200001.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Sakura Front source courtesy http://sakura.weathermap.jp/</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ueno lake and gardens happen to be the center of attraction for the sakura season in Tokyo. The waters of the lake take a pink hue with the petals falling in. Areas under the trees around come to life with bonhomie and laughter.</p>
<div id="attachment_731" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-731" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00003.jpg" alt="Cherry blossoms in Ueno Park" width="521" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00003.jpg 521w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00003-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00003-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cherry blossoms in Ueno Park</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asakusa area especially the Asakusa Sumida river side, comes close to Ueno in terms of the number of people celebrating Hanami. Asakusa is home  to the largest Buddhist shrine, the Sensoji, and is the de facto torchbearer of traditional culture in Tokyo. The lanterns hung from the branches, the people in colorful traditional dress, it all takes one&#8217;s mind away from the daily grinds of a salaryman life and takes one back to the simple days of past. Hand drawn rickshaws ply on the roads, to nudge the memories, to shake the stifling citizenry into a soothing trance.</p>
<div id="attachment_729" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-729" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00006.jpg" alt="Hanami by the side of Sumida River Asakusa " width="680" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00006.jpg 680w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00006-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanami by the side of Sumida River Asakusa</p></div>
<p>This experience of olden days resonates through the mantras and with the sound of the bell at Zojoji, the family temple of the Shoguns, as it welcomes spring. Next to Tokyo tower, the entire Shiba Koen area comes alive in unison with the pink and white theme of the cherry blossoms around.</p>
<div id="attachment_725" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-725" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00002.jpg" alt="Cherry blossoms in Zojoji" width="361" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00002.jpg 361w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00002-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00002-300x433.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cherry blossoms in Zojoji</p></div>

<div id="attachment_727" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-727" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00004-208x300.jpg" alt="Hanabi under the cherry trees - Okima Komatsugawa" width="208" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00004-208x300.jpg 208w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00004-300x433.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00004.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanabi under the cherry trees &#8211; Okima Komatsugawa</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s however a digression for just one week, maximum two. The bare branches of cherry trees suddenly wake up one morning full of flowers. The bloom signals the end of ills and beginning of hope. Japanese society, isolated in Pacific divided in a thousand islands, pounded by Tsunamis shaken by quakes, learned to cope with nature. People do not break into hopelessness when nature expresses its fury on mankind, neither it falls shy to celebrate when nature shows its kind side. Rather it has taken upon itself to celebrate in full vigor everything that nature offers. Communities break into dance and singing festas. A few glimpses are in here.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><a style="color: #ff00ff;" href="https://youtu.be/8wU_SSgq02I" target="_blank">Youtube video &#8211; celebrating hanami in song and dance</a>  </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No wonder people over time have tried to extend this season, engineering nature. Japan is the land that invented Bonsais, miniature trees that are trees in their own right but designed by man. So it is in order that Sakuras of varieties that bloom early, live longer have been carefully grown. Nature gave company, with varieties that welcome spring, and ones that signal it is about to leave spreading across Japan. Named Somei Yoshino, and such others&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom" target="_blank">Wikipedia &#8211; types and details of cherry blossoms</a></p>
<div id="attachment_722" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-722" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00007.jpg" alt="Sakura at Lake Kawaguchiko" width="681" height="521" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00007.jpg 681w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/SAKURA00007-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sakura at Lake Kawaguchiko</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quest for symbolism, of hope, of rejuvenation, though went farther. Sakuras of all varieties do one day go. So society embraced new symbols in plum and Wisteria. Plum has been made the usher. The early variety of cherry blossoms come holding hands of the bright pink plum. And the late variety of cherry blossoms pass its crown over to Wisteria. A lush pink that lives till May. And the celebration continues, in places around such as Kameido Tenjin shrine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.gotokyo.org/en/kanko/koto/event/fujimatsuri.html" target="_blank">Kameido Tenjin Wisteria Festival</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the wisterias dry out, spring finally bids goodbye, summer sets in. But the year rolls on inspired, Hanami season replaced by Hanabi season. Summer is synonymous with fireworks festivals &#8211; Hanabi. Natures colors get multiplied in a man-made sparkle of colors that cover the night skies around. We will talk about that in a later piece. Till then good bye and God bless. Happy Hanami</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Winter Weather</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How is winter in Japan? Mild pleasant, to bitter cold, answers can vary depending on whom you are asking. Even though it is not the longest or the widest of land mass known to humans, the weather varies widely. Hokkaido island in the North is cold, very cold, neighbor to Siberia. Okinawa island in south is mild, hot, akin to some of the white sand island gateways one sees in holiday brochures. In between, it&#8217;s a mix. Too much of mix if I may say. Within the main island of Honshu, home to 100 million which is ⅘ of Japan&#8217;s population, one half enjoys summer while the other half shovels ice to keep roadways open. Tokyo on the east side of the island might have already woken up from the hangover of spring parties, when Tateyama in west of the same island tries to manage a pathway running through 60 feet high snow!</p>
<div id="attachment_672" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-672 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR100001-300x230.jpg" alt="Tateyama Snow Canyon : Courtesy Uryah - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6746633" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR100001-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR100001.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tateyama Snow Canyon : Courtesy Uryah &#8211; Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6746633</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.alpen-route.com/en/" target="_blank">Tateyama snow canyon</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So yes winter varies here, a tad bit widely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But that is probably not the answer we intend to hear, right? Rational beings that we are, we should look at the Max, Min, Average and variances to understand the full picture. For example in Tokyo the average Max and Min temperatures are 10 and 2 degrees centigrade for the 4 months of winter between December and March. It snows, for about a couple of days. For up to a couple of inches. Sometimes enough for the neighborhood kids to take out those plastic sleds onto the streets. Severe snow in 2013 stopped the trains and made people take a day “working from home”. It happened once only after 100 years.</p>
<div id="attachment_664" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-664" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00007-300x300.jpg" alt="Winter 2013 in Tokyo neighborhoods" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00007-300x300.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00007-150x150.jpg 150w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00007.jpg 521w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Winter 2013 in Tokyo neighborhoods</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the other 99 years it&#8217;s been generally mild. It rains in winter, but not enough to cause traffic disruption or a day off at home. This is the season for influenza though. If you see scores of people wearing white masks rushing out of a underground station exit, it means influenza is spreading amongst office goers.</p>
<div id="attachment_670" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-670" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR100003-231x300.jpg" alt="Christmas lights in Tokyo shopping mall" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR100003-231x300.jpg 231w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR100003-300x390.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR100003.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Christmas lights in Tokyo shopping mall</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Winter used to be more cold in Tokyo, according to the old timers. But no longer so. Blame it on global warming. Blame it on changing pattern of  ocean currents. Or the Sun&#8217;s flares. Whatever. But as the calendar turns its pages from October to November, preparation for winter starts in town. Shopping malls and tourist places deck up in Christmas lights. Ads for Seasons sales flash on TV, on the LCD screens inside the metro trains, on bill boards at road junctions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Winter sports</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though Tokyo is kind of umm hot, the right kinda cold with the right kinda snow still covers a vast region for the ski lovers. Ski resorts in Nagano, and Niigata prefectures in West Honshu are wildly popular; Nagano was the host of Winter Olympics in 1998. Karuizawa town, just about 1.5 hours drive from Tokyo is a fashionable mall city with ski resort attached!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Another well known ski area,Yuzawa, has resorts that connect to ski slopes directly from the train station. It is just above an hours journey from Tokyo by Shinkansen, so convenience combined with quality ski is a key attraction here. Possibly the best established facilities for international skiers though is in the north, in Hokkaido. Tourists from Australia head straight to ski huts managed by expats who could not escape the lure of Hokkaido puff. If interested have a look into the following web sites</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if not a hard core skier or having a family with kids, you could still enjoy skiing in regions close to Tokyo, in economical day-return or weekend packages offered by Japan railways and some other private operators.

<p style="text-align: justify;">For something closer home, enthusiasts head to ice skating, for a mix of sports with artistic expression. A number of indoor and outdoor rinks pop up in winter. Few like the indoor rinks in Tokyo Omotesando and Mizue open doors early at the onset of winter and continue till summer is around. And then in summer turn into swimming pools. But the others like the outdoor one at Akasaka literally appear out of nowhere, run for two months in the peak winter months of January/February and then vanish. In any case, the venues crowd out pretty soon on weekends and you have to be really skillful to find your way through the heaving mass all enjoying their winter day out! But more on ice skating in another writeup later.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Winter festivities</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from skiing Winter is otherwise also a season for celebrations. Sapporo snow festival is world renowned for fabulous ice sculptures. Held every year in Hokkaido, the creations by international teams draw large number of tourists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.snowfes.com/english/">http://www.snowfes.com/english/</a></p>
<div id="attachment_661" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-661 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00003-300x206.jpg" alt="Sapporo Snow Festival : Courtesy Materialscientist - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8298998" width="300" height="206" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00003-300x206.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00003-130x90.jpg 130w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/JPNWINTR00003.jpg 681w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sapporo Snow Festival : Courtesy Materialscientist &#8211; Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8298998</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another festival popular with tourists is the Kamakura festival in Akita prefecture. A tradition over many centuries, locals build huts from snow, light up with fire in the evening and invite guests over for food and drinks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In many prefectures there are traditional winter sports held for the youth, such as competing for grabbing a stick, in cold, dressed only in bare minimal. Then there is this hit the unlucky ones event, wherein all 25 year old and 42 year old men in a village are chased down the streets with snow balls aimed at their bare bodies. These people who attained 25 years or 42 years of age are supposed to be unlucky so they must be thrashed! Matter of principle, reminiscent somewhat of similar dunking in ice water event held across Russia and the Nordics. For the more sedate, there are evening parades called Yuki Toro where people parade through or dance in the snow with lit torches / lanterns in hand.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Winter Leisure</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Winter can be the time for ultimate relaxation. By sheer coincidence the year end holidays happen to come around winter. And when the day is a holiday, outside is chilly, what better to do than relaxing inside in a warm ambiance. In Japan this relaxation can extend beyond the mental, relaxing you physically as well. Soaking in a hot onsen bath, while it is snowing outside, can be the ultimate relaxation both mentally and physically. It is a tradition to hit the onsens after a hard day out skiing. This tradition is said to be old, really old, predating even the arrival of human beings. Monkeys have known this for ages, and are known to partake in the pleasures of onsen bath amidst the snowy hinterlands of Nagano.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Japan in fact is culturally a society very close to nature. The four seasons of Spring Summer Autumn and Winter are celebrated across. The wide range of temperatures have given rise to individual traditions in each region, and Winter is no exception. If you plan to.visit Japan, even smack in the midst of winter you can perhaps experience something unique to remember about. So, answer to the question How is Japan in Winter is&#8230;fun, just like autumn spring and summer.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tofukuji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The night opened into another cloudy day. Weather was expected to clear out in the second half after a light drizzle. Today it is a journey to the south, south of Kyoto. We will take JR Nara line from Kyoto station. A small toy train like 2 compartment train stood at the designated platform. Destination Tofukuji. People from around Japan come to Toukuji for its autumn colors.</p>
<div id="attachment_604" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-604" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021-300x210.jpg" alt="JR Nara line to Tofukuji" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021-300x210.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021-130x90.jpg 130w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00021.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">JR Nara line to Tofukuji</p></div>
<div id="attachment_610" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-610" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006-300x228.jpg" alt="Way to Tofukiji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00006.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to Tofukiji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path out of the station was narrow and perhaps would have benefited from more direction in English. Google maps saved. There is a way that runs parallel to the railway track and another one takes left. Seeing a temple on the left, we ignored the GPS directions and walked towards it. It turned out to be a family temple of some vintage. Thankfully local volunteers posted directions at points along the way to Tofukuji. It helped us navigate our way back.</p>
<div id="attachment_609" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-609" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005-300x228.jpg" alt="Viewing bridge, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00005.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Viewing bridge, Tofukuji</p></div>
<div id="attachment_611" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00009.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-611" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00009-300x228.jpg" alt="Entrance, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00009-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00009-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00009.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Entrance, Tofukuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But this short detour uncovered a part of Kyoto that would have remained unseen otherwise. The two sides of the way leading to Tofukuji are residences of priests each calling a temple home. The temples on the two sides were gorgeous at one time no doubt but perhaps fell in disuse over time. The tradition of dispensing traditional food from the temples continues still, though in a more commercial way. Food kiosks are set up on the gates run by family members of respective house holds.</p>
<div id="attachment_614" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00012.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-614" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00012-300x228.jpg" alt="View from the bridge, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00012-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00012-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00012.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View from the bridge, Tofukuji</p></div>
<div id="attachment_612" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-612" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010-300x228.jpg" alt="Head priests tomb, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00010.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Head priests tomb, Tofukuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon the high boundary walls of Tofukuji, partially draped in bamboo groves, came into view. The way inside the familiar Torii gate was covered in gravels, it was wide and had a boulevard kind of appearance. Trees neatly trimmed, sign posts welcome visitors. The path came to a wide crossing, flanked on two sides by priests quarters and ticket gate.</p>
<div id="attachment_602" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-602" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019-300x228.jpg" alt="Moss covered garden, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00019.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Moss covered garden, Tofukuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way from the ticket gate headed left. We entered into a covered wooden veranda. The walkway led to a garden path down stone-steps. Further ahead it becomes a bridge over a small stream. The entire garden, the valley, the stream and the way up the passage, everywhere it was a riot of colors. If there was a God of Autumn, she might have left the most precious gems from her collection in here. Somewhat strikingly, this was a zen temple meditating in steadfast austerity, in the middle of unabashed beauty around.</p>
<div id="attachment_606" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-606" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00002-300x228.jpg" alt="Walkway up, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00002-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00002-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00002.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Walkway up, Tofukuji</p></div>
<div id="attachment_598" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00015.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-598" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00015-300x228.jpg" alt="Walkway thru garden, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00015-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00015-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00015.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Walkway thru garden, Tofukuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The covered passage went up in steps, turned, turned again, and reached up to the top. The main hall of prayer stood there. Heavy wooden doors of a courtyard opened in. Inside, a stone paved road went straight on to the base of the shrine. On one side lay a lily pond. with gold fish swimming around. The other side there was this  rock garden covered in sand, marked in linear zen patterns. At one end there was a wooden sitting area, thoughtfully positioned to let the visitors spend some time in silent introspection. Chance for us to take in the sights and sounds in, at our own pace. Tourists from around the world came in, sat quietly.</p>
<div id="attachment_599" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00016.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-599" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00016-300x228.jpg" alt="Central Hall, Tofukuji" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00016-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00016-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/TOFUKU00016.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Central Hall, Tofukuji</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting back up, we stepped into the garden. Maple and Japanese pines lined the paths. Green moss was covered with scattered red and yellow maple leaves. A set of stone obelisks stood under a maple, witness to the times. The maple covered walk descended in steps down towards the stream. A little stone bridge crossed the ravine, and went up the mossy garden route back to the wooden walkway. As we crossed the bridge, and went few steps up the stone paved route,  the complete wooden bridge and the veranda came into view. Not quite complete, to be honest, as part of it was bedecked in maple colors. The sky partially cleared, with streaks of blue being visible.  Sun shone through the leaves. It was a panorama fit for artists easel. It was nature&#8217;s own painting, may be by Benzaiten the God of art herself!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">  The way back was a dramatic change, sudden descent from the heavenly to the mundane. The underside of the overhead train-line cast its shadow beneath. The road was narrow. Dwellings showed the marks of time, and perhaps of downward fortunes. Ironically, one thought, it&#8217;s perhaps how things in life are meant to be like. Without the contrast being there, the beauty left behind would not have appeared so precious, so surreal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We reached the small station. Next stop was immediately the next station on the same line &#8211; Fushimi Inari.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ginkakuji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After Kinkakuji next destination was Ginkakuji. We wandered back to the bus stop, world heritage sign pointing backwards. Time for a quick time check. Finished lunch at the 1st floor small but cosy glass covered family run restaurant. right by the crossing. Then it was time to head back to the city center. The next destination Ginkakuji, was in the eastern fringe. Ginkakuji was originally a retirement villa, similar to Kinkakuji. It was set up by the grandson of the Shogun who originally built Kinkakuji. So it had similar streaks of grand ambition, but in between the two generations economic situation changed. Cultural mores also changed. Thus the style used in Ginkakuji turned out to be different from its predecessor and inspiration. Unbeknownst to the creators at that time, Ginkakuji style started the next era in Japanese cultural and architectural heritage. So it was naturally the next item on our itinerary; we simply followed directions.</p>

<div id="attachment_583" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-583" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006-300x228.jpg" alt="Ginkakuji side view" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00006.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginkakuji side view</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bus from Kyoto station reach Ginkakuji in about 40 minutes. As we reached, we noticed the area was still the outskirts of the main city. Even after 500 years, and anointment as world heritage site, the ambiance around afforded a village like feel  Not bad for retirement even now, quipped my companion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the ticket gate, the narrow lane leads to a wooden door. The main shrine comes into view as one steps past the door onto the other side. It`s wooden pagoda style multi storied structure has borne the brunt of many typhoons and earthquakes but standing tall. Built by a lily pond, its name Ginakuji, the silver shrine, is said to have come from its reflections in the pond on a moonlit night.</p>
<div id="attachment_582" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-582" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013-300x228.jpg" alt="Ginkakuji hall of Amida Buddha " width="300" height="228" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00013.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginkakuji hall of Amida Buddha</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A circular path curled its way from the left of the shrine past several wooden buildings, crossing over a stream, onto a ridge and back down to the other side of Ginkakuji. This whole area was only for the eyes of the Shogun, to rest his mind from the turmoils of bruising past.</p>
<div id="attachment_574" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-574" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020-300x243.jpg" alt="Ginkakuji Shoguns liibrary" width="300" height="243" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020-300x243.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020-1024x829.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00020.jpg 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ginkakuji Shoguns liibrary</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right at the beginning of the walk, once comes across a sand pit with a sand obelisk in the middle. Very Shinto-like, uniquely different from the zen style in Kinkakuji. The sand layer had delicately carved lines sketched across, as if to represent the marks of time on the eternal. Next as we walked past another gate, we were ushered into the outer garden. This was a wide boulevard around the lily pond, with bridges and bamboo groves carving a leisurely path around it. On one side of the garden there was this prayer hall, with intricately carved Amida Buddha statue inside. Next was the library.  The path forked here, one going up the hill bordering the estate. The entire path is not open to visitors. Even then from atop  one gets a commanding view of the Kyoto city, with mountains in distance. We reached the high point about time the sun was setting. The red afternoon glow made the whole view magical. Autumn colors of Japanese maple trees blazed in red and orange.</p>
<div id="attachment_578" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-578" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011-1024x777.jpg" alt="Evening from top Ginkakuji" width="660" height="501" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011-1024x777.jpg 1024w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011-300x228.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/GINKA00011.jpg 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Evening from top Ginkakuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was not hard to imagine  how Ginkakuji would have come to influence the following generations of artisans and authors in Japan. The Shogun, the commander of the mighty army bowing to the supreme nature in all humility, presented the plot around which many playacts were made.  It was an expression of the power  of the subtle, the silent, that eventually subsumes the egoistic boundaries of man.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As we stood there viewing the last rays of the sun, amidst the bunch of tourists assembled from across the world, we kind of felt like we were  actors in a play. In this play of history, the audience were the hills the maple tress the bamboo groves the lily pond the tea room the prayer halls. The script remained sane for hundreds of years, only  the actors changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day was about to bid adieu. The red glow of the evening sky lengthened  the shadows falling on the water.  It was time to head back to reality. The sloping way back through the village drew villagers into the path of the tourists. A glance and a bow followed a hesitant smile. Rows of curio shops beckoned by the pavement. We headed back to the bus stop. Next day would be a very busy day. We would need to download the photos, recharge the camera/phone/tablet,  miles to go before we sleep.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kinkakuji</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next morning we started early. Our destination &#8211; Kinkakuji, in the north west of the city. Subway seemed to be the faster option. From Subway Kitaoji station, it&#8217;s a short bus or taxi ride. We were excited. Kinkakuji is said to be the living representation of the Japan seen in calendars and travel magazines.</p>
<div id="attachment_545" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-545" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025.jpg" alt="Way to Kinkakuji" width="690" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025.jpg 690w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00025-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to Kinkakuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Established by feudal lord in the golden era of Kyoto, it stands to embody the highest echelons of Japanese traditions and philosophy.  Originally a retirement villa, it was a private estate surrounding a lake at the base of a hill. Later on it was converted into zen Buddhist shrine. The entire area comprising of the hill, the lake and the valley around makes Kinkakuji. The central villa is crowned in golden tiles, from which the name Kinakuji the &#8220;golden pavilion&#8221; originated.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Entering the complex</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bus dropped us at a corner. World heritage signs caught attention. Even in the chilly morning, a steady stream of visitors were heading up the path pointed to by the sign. A paved road went through a garden full of cedar and maple. It is second week of November.</p>
<div id="attachment_540" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020.jpg"><img class="wp-image-540 size-medium" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020-300x230.jpg" alt="Way to Kinkakuji" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00020.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Way to Kinkakuji</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The greenery was already thinning, replaced by bright colors of Red and orange. The two sides of the bamboo-fenced road were bright and cheerful in clear morning sun. The underside of the trees was covered with a thick carpet of green moss. At one point the road divided into two, one going straight in through the entry gate (Torii) and the other coming out of the exit in the right. We stopped several times on our way towards the Torii, trying to capture the morning rays shining onto the green carpet through the colored foliage. But the steady stream of tourists played spoilsport. It was a reminder that its fall season in Kyoto, and we were right in front of one of the best known world heritage sites. The crowd was to be expected. No option, so we  moved on along with the crowd.</p>
<div id="attachment_553" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-553" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji a closer view" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00009-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kinkakuji a closer view</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entering through the Torii, at once we found ourselves facing a vast garden. The vastness of the garden was a sudden change from the busy outside. It was a vast expanse of land with manicured trees, bell tower, lily pond, bridge. The rush of people became slow, people trying to reconcile with the vastness of it all. The buzz quietened down. It was as if a scripted act. Done to prepare the visitors for the imminent next stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another gate stood protecting the path to the final inner sanctum. Time to get our tickets. Past the ticket gate we headed through a narrow path. It opened into a wide vista. There Kinkakuji appeared, right in front of our eyes, shining, its reflection shimmering in the lake. Ducks swimming. Mild breeze buzzing through a bamboo grove nearby.</p>
<div id="attachment_549" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-549" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji views" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00005-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kinkakuji views</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shadow of white clouds on a blue sky played with the reflection of the golden pagoda in water. Gold fishes were swimming around the lake shore, unafraid. Peace. Tranquility. Eternal calm, yes this was it. It was a moment for reflection.</p>
<div id="attachment_551" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-551" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji through autumn foliage" width="574" height="441" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007.jpg 574w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KINKA00007-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kinkakuji through autumn foliage</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walking by</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrow clay walking path led towards the pavilion. We moved, we stood, took in the view, and moved again. A clutch of thatched houses by the right separated themselves by a fence. These ones house the monks who continue to live the centuries old traditions.  Japanese pine bent up on left, by the golden pavilions. Maple grove behind the golden pavilion led up a narrow path uphill. Red orange colored maple leaf floated in water, lay around on green moss covered hillside, lay under feet up the stone paved stairs going up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the hilltop, there was a tea room, opening its view towards the vast estate down below. The master stood here, offering the cup of green elixir in obeisance before taking the first sip. In mornings, in evenings, days and nights, the aroma filled in as the thoughts reverberated through the air. Karma is said to live through lives, reappearing through reincarnations.  Was that a reason all these seemed so familiar, seen long ago?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Uh the nudge from fellow traveler woke me up. Continued on the path that now wound down the other side. We found ourselves by a private courtyard, lived in, living the life lived by generations before. A family busy in daily life, watering the gardens, washing and hanging clothes on the clothesline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A normal day to day life, differentiated only by the fact that it is a life of a privileged, life unhindered by stress of civilization outside.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The road headed past around into the prayer hall. Devotees were kneeling, clasping their arms in Pranam posture, lighting incense sticks. Smoke curled up from the bronze stand. We stood, observing as the light and shadow played in the portals of the wooden building. The rush of the morning, the excitement, all seemed to unwarranted, so unbecoming of where we were to come to. It was not a place to visit, but a place to be in, to blend, to belong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kinkakuji is Japan. Quintessential Japan. At least that is the Japan I always envisioned. Ah, we envisioned, the milling millions who passed by the gates of this hallowed precinct for hundreds of years gone by. And will pass by. Join them o reader, by all means if you can. Aum.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Kyoto</h2>
<p>Kyoto. The old capital of the land of rising sun. A center for culture and arts unchanged for more than a millennium. A world heritage so unique that at the time when the flames of war gripped the entire nation, Kyoto remained unstirred, engrossed in solemn meditation. If one place you must see in the far east, this must be it. And if it is the season of autumn colors, when the hills around the capital get flushed red and orange, above the golden pavilions of the palace, can you really afford not to go visit Kyoto? Well we could not not do it. Join us as we take a tour down the memory lanes of our travel to this magical city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The journey started with a ride in Shinkansen the bullet train from Tokyo station. We took a right hand side seat, to enjoy the view of Mt. Fuji in the morning. Soon the train picked up speed. But somewhat disappointingly there was hardly any feeling of the speed as there was no vibration inside. It was more like flying in an airplane where you do not feel anything about the speed once in the air. Anyway in less than three hours Kyoto station arrived. As the travelers alighted the white aerodynamic machine zoomed past into the horizon. Hotel check-in was from the afternoon. So dropping the luggage into station lockers, we headed for the bus to Kyomizudera.</p>
<h2>The pavilion of faith</h2>
<p>One of the most revered shrines in Kyoto, Kyomizudera is also famous for the Autumn colors. Its about a half hour journey by bus.</p>
<div id="attachment_524" style="width: 191px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00006.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-524" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00006-181x300.jpg" alt="Kiyomizudera from Kyoto station" width="181" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00006-181x300.jpg 181w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00006.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kiyomizudera from Kyoto station</p></div>
<p>Getting down from bus, one takes an uphill road through the narrow lane chok -a-block with art and craft shops on the two sides. Deciding to take a peek later on our way back, we carry on. The wide stone paved entrance goes up through a magnificent Torii gate. As one walks up, the bell tower falls on the left.</p>
<div id="attachment_525" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-525" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00001-300x230.jpg" alt="Kiyomizudera bell tower" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00001-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00001.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kiyomizudera bell tower</p></div>
<p>The ornate work on the bell in the otherwise austere premises of the monastery is worth a mention. A few more stairs takes to landing level. The viewing pavilion is right about here.</p>
<div id="attachment_526" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-526" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00002-300x230.jpg" alt="Way up towards the pavilion" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00002-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00002.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Way up towards the pavilion</p></div>
<p>A wide view of the city of Kyoto is visible from the steep precipice. Maples bedecked in autumn red and yellow usher in the devotees along the pavilion. And do the devotees follow! Viewing autumn colors from the pavilion of Kiyomizudera is a ritual, a journey taken by millions every year. People move in, move out, taking in not just the view but fulfilling a solemn duty of obeisance to the supreme being.</p>
<div id="attachment_521" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00004.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-521" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00004-300x230.jpg" alt="Viewing from the pavilion" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00004-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00004.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Viewing from the pavilion</p></div>
<p>Kiyomizudera stands there not as just one of the shrines, but as The one most revered. In times of despair people were known to take the ultimate leap of faith from the high precincts of this shrine down below. The ones who survived were the blessed ones, sure to stand up and win in the battles that followed.</p>
<p>From the pavilion, a bridge on the left leads to a small temple in the middle of a lily pond.</p>
<div id="attachment_522" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00005.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-522" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00005-300x230.jpg" alt="Fish pond" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00005-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00005.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fish pond</p></div>
<p>Gold fishes swimming in the pond create ripples in the shadow of the temple in water. Past The ticket gate on the right the way leads to the prayer hall. This whole complex lights up in the evening during the autumn color days. In fact this whole eastern fringe of the city is host to a collection of great temples and shrines. Shrines like Kodaiji Nanzenj along the philosophers path. The entire stretch wear a festive color in autumn. We walked, stopped, wondered and moved again.</p>
<h2>Crafts worth a kings ransom</h2>
<p>The craft shops were crafts in themselves, so eloquently decked up in colorful artifacts. Tourists ambled around, appreciating the display of traditional art . A simple matte finish jar with a crane painted in white. A gorgeously colorful vase done in lac, brushed with natural colors. Brilliant gold maple on black base. Some vintage, tracing a proud history of their own. From the humble memento to the prized souvenir, the alley of shops had it all. Price tags sometimes stretched to accommodate the extra zeroes. But that&#8217;s not the point here. Have you collected that shell from the beaches of Hawaii, or the adobe ware from market of Morocco, or that onyx jewelry from the Andes? It is that deep sense of attachment that these mementos are for. This is what this place is famous for &#8211; giving the opportunity to the worshiper to hold the memory of the worshiped close whenever one wants to.  Visiting Kyoto, the capital of the kingdom was always a long cherished dream for a mostly agrarian population across Japan. Kiyomizudera for them was the place of worship, to submit, to surrender. In this background the trip through the pavilions, through the prayer halls, finally winding down the craft alley ended  a journey worth a lifetime memory. Trinkets picked up by the traveler for his or her near and dear ones, or just for ones own memory, were no less worth than a kings treasure.</p>
<div id="attachment_528" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00008.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00008-300x157.jpg" alt="Crafts worth a kings ransom" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00008-300x157.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00008-390x205.jpg 390w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/KIYO00008.jpg 841w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crafts worth a kings ransom</p></div>
<p>The road winded its way into Gion market. One wanted some time to sit down and cherish the sights seen. But it was already a full days travel and we were yet to get into our hotel. So we decided to retire for the day.</p>
<p>As we took the bus back to Kyoto station, the station seemed to be too busy intruding into the otherwise sedate evening mood.  There was a multicolor musical water fountain setup in the station premises. We did not notice it in the morning. Nice, a bit too touristy, and perhaps a good digression for the tourist family with kids standing next, apparently enjoying the show.  The inside of the station was already lit up with Christmas decorations. Shinkansens, other long distance trains and suburban trains kept pouring in bunch of people every other minute. We headed to buy the city bus tickets for the next day from the ticket office in front of the station. Then collected luggage from the lockers and hopped in to a suburban train. Google maps indicated In 15 minutes we were to be at the place we would call home for next three nights. We deliberately booked this hotel at a suburban location. The place was less crowded, less touristy, conveniently connected, and most importantly, during this time of the year in Kyoto, its was still affordable. But thats beside the story.</p>
<p>Next morning would start early. It was the day for visiting Kinkakuji, literally meaning the Golden Pavilion. We were tired, but excited. Quickly fell asleep thinking about the days happenings, the colors, the crafts……..to be continued</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Japan&#8217;s food and drinks are as much an experience as is Akihabara&#8217;s  Otaku or Kyoto&#8217;s zen.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Washoku</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Washoku in Japanese means true Japanese food. Talk about washoku, and you will have your Japanese friend turn nostalgic. Traditionally the main Japanese food is rice or noodles with toppings. Japanese rice is usually small grained and sticky, easy to grapple with chopsticks.  But that&#8217;s a coarse description. Washoku-ians would talk about those specific varieties of rice that grow in so and so prefecture. Rice is often served in a bowl covered with toppings. Toppings vary, a favorite  being raw egg. Along side the main dish, there&#8217;a a rich choice of side dishes. Side dishes could be fried in batter. Called &#8220;Tempura&#8221;. Or could be grilled and dipped in sauce. Heard of &#8220;Unagi&#8221;? Its Eel grilled and dipped in sauce; super delectable for the washoku patron. A soup comprising of tofu and/or green sea weeds (&#8220;nori&#8221;) usually accompany the main dish. Meal is finished with green tea, hot or cold.</p>
<div id="attachment_512" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-512" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002-210x300.jpg" alt="True Japanese food Washoku" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002-210x300.jpg 210w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002-300x430.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00002.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">True Japanese food Washoku</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rice is home food. Rolled into nice triangles with fillers is the quintessential &#8220;Onigiri&#8221; &#8211; the fulfilling lunch for the school boy. Noodles, are well a bit more formal, calls for more work to prepare it, and connotes an office goers lunch option kind of sense. Salarymen in Japan head for a quick bowl of noodles from favorite noodles shop. Depending on type of ingredient rice or wheat can be of several types Soba, Udon and Ramen. Udon topped with shredded roasted beef is &#8220;giu-udon&#8221;, a popular lunch item for the &#8220;salaryman&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_508" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-508" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004-300x250.jpg" alt="Onigiri" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004-300x250.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00004.jpg 529w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Onigiri</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amongst side dishes, Fries called &#8220;Tempura&#8221;, could make use of any item one throws at it, kind of. Vegetarian? Try eggplant or gourd tempura. Others could try chicken nuggets, squid ring fries, and &#8220;you name it item fried&#8221;  tempura. Tempura are prepared like French fries deep fried dipped in a batter. When not fried, grilled or barbecued, the item is called Yaki&#8221;you name it item&#8221; for example yakitori is grilled chicken, a very popular food choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an island, local palate is also big on seafood. Sea food special restaurants go a long way to serve the bestest available to connoisseurs. For example  you can demand to know the origin of each mussel being served, before you so much as squeeze that lemon. Yes each one catch is individually marked with its place of origin, handwritten in Kanji on a chip of wood, to satisfy the connoisseur. Fresh sea food delicately sliced and tastefully served is what makes a special Japanese meal. But in non-special ordinary meal as well, you can expect fresh fish served right to you before you can even utter Fish. Fresh sliced fish is a culinary variety of its own &#8211; named &#8220;Sashimi&#8221;. And when the individual pieces of fish are wrapped around a mound of rice served neatly arranged in an exquisitely designed platter, it&#8217;s &#8220;Sushi&#8221;. The emphasis is on fresh, pure, and low fat. Variety is there even within the sashimi or sushi  dishes in the form of tuna, Mackerel, octopus, squid, sea urchins, crab meat, prawns etc. To generalize, Fish and rice makes the ever popular &#8220;mamas own&#8221; dish, can be taken for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner.</p>
<div id="attachment_507" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-507" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003-224x300.jpg" alt="Sushi" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003-224x300.jpg 224w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003-300x402.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00003.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sushi</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now as any self-respecting Michelin-star chef would let you know, food when taken fresh in its natural environs of origin, has a different taste. Japan is big on regional food. Rice from Miyagi prefecture is Pearl rice, such shining such special it is. You have to visit Miyagi prefecture to get that fresh shiny rice. Similarly Mussels from the north have that flavor oh so delicious. Beef from south especially Kobe beef has its own brand identity, protected with pride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not just regions but seasons have their own sway for Japanese palate. Fall colors bring in the catch of silvery Sanma fish. If walking in the park or river side while taking in the fall colors you get a waft of barbecue, its likely to be Sanma. Barbecue is very popular, and so is Sanma. Similarly after the rains, its mushroom time. Mushrooms of all colors sizes textures show up in dishes but the special one, comparable in prestige to  French black truffles, is Shitake mushroom. You can not go wrong if serving shitake to your Japanese guests.</p>
<div id="attachment_510" style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-510" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006-252x300.jpg" alt="Natto" width="252" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006-252x300.jpg 252w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006-300x357.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00006.jpg 371w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Natto</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A discussion about Washoku can go on and on, the choices are rich and varied. Some items though stand apart meriting a mention on their own. For example&#8221;Natto&#8221;. In its simplest form its pure fermented soybean. Valued due to its nutritional value, known due to its rather challenging smell. Adventurous tourists include natto into their &#8220;lets try it&#8221; list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of the taste of the food items, Japanese overwhelmingly prefer food dipped in soy sauce, and vinegar. Mayonnaise is a recent entrant to go with tempura. But tomato sauce still tastes ahem foreign. Japanese curry is a more recent innovation, drawn from Indian variety, and is getting quite popular. But if you are one who likes the delicate natural taste with just a punch of twang, without all the spice of a curry, you can add Wasabi. It is like mustard but is actually derived from plant root. Just like chilies of certain fame, wasabi also can bite so readers beware. Next, sweet, as a taste is tolerated, not exactly cherished. Sweets in the form of bean paste rolled inside a thin layer of gelatinous rice or wheat is popular as a candy . People buy these sweets as memento from a distant place visited. Sour taste is mostly had in fruits, and fruit flavored drinks and candies, nowhere else. Bitter as a taste is conspicuously absent. Its place is taken by a taste called Umami, a Japanese taste now recognized as one of the primary tastes apart from sweet sour bitter salty. Its difficult to explain unless you have tasted it. If you have done, then please help explain for readers here&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Modernization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else food preferences change, new ingredients come up, or just new tastes develop. Japanese food habits are no exception. Lets take for example, in this fast fast world, you did not have the time to lick your lovingly prepared dish to the end. Do you throw the left over? Nope, not in Japan. &#8220;Mottai Nai&#8221; waste not is taught to children from early childhood. So necessity for reuse in small family fast life has given rise to a new food &#8211; Okonomiyaki. Left overs from &#8220;preloved&#8221; food sauted and fried together into a pancake is the new food okonomiyaki. Witnesses abound who swear its taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talking about modernization in food, food technology, food storage, one can talk perhaps endlessly. But the really path-breaking breakthrough came through instant noodles. It came in a giant leap, not in just a small step, if you know what I mean. Say yyou have a project to submit, no time to cook, not enough money to buy a good one. Grab a cup full of instant noodles. The sheer varieties ensure its quite likely that the cup is having all ingredients of your choice added. Just open the tap, add hot water and stir for a few blips on the clock. Your supper is ready. Just like toast and baked beans in the hostels of Western Hemisphere, this item has sustained several generations of student population in Asia. Nissin invented instant noodles. It became a legend. It is not just a company that makes &#8220;fast food&#8221; it touches an emotional chord amongst the Japanese youth.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ushoku</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">International food, distinctly non-Japanese, is what is called Ushoku &#8211; literally meaning imported food. Italian pasta ingredients are widely available, as are Indian curry spices. Bread and butter may not be quite that &#8220;bread and butter&#8221; amongst daily food choices but increasing consumption has caused shortfalls lately in the market resulting even in rationing of butter and cheese! All said though, except for dedicated Establishment selling imported European stuff, the quality or the variety of cheese and bread available at your neighborhood may leave you underwhelmed. Milk products generally are available with various degrees of fat, but the general availability being on the side of the less the better, you may not find your favorite thick creamy yogurt around. But you can double on milk extracted from soya bean. As for cheese, Tofu the cheese made from Soybean is by far dominating the foreign ones. Do not assume though that you may have to substitute your mozzarella toppings with tofu, no. You can order you pizza or pasta as you would anywhere elsewhere.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Fruits and vegetables</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fruits though expensive are available aplenty. Apples and cherries are also grown locally apart from importing. Some grapes are also grown in areas around Mt Fuji, mostly in wineries. Strawberries are also a popular produce. Strawberry picking is an annual event encouraging more people to participate in the farm activity. Round pears called Nashi are a seasonal favorite. Kaki A juicy fleshy fruit looking like square shaped tomato deserves special mention for its taste and flavor. Peaches and Plums are a revered traditional local fruit produce, exclusively used for producing fruit liquor. Fruits occupy a special place in Japanese psyche, as a delicacy, as a source of prized alcoholic beverages.  But the love for fruits have stepped out of the reigns of home into corporate culture. For the Japanese corporate nothing beats an executive gift like the perfectly round melon. The very best produce is often auctioned and presented as gifts to corporate top shots or political bigwigs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the vegetables department, choices are however somewhat short.  Most being of the root types. Mushrooms will delight mushroom aficionados. Shiitake mushrooms are particularly prized for its taste and nutritional value. Daily Green vegetable need in balanced diet is provided by seaweed called nori. Eggplant, spinach are the other few types of vegetables commonly available, but often with an uncommon or uncomfortable price!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Desserts</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the word desserts brings an image of a dollop of chocolate,  you will certainly not be disappointed. Chocolate covered this chocolate covered that, this dipped in chocolate, that rolled into chocolate are all there. And there is ice creams. But these are mostly later day imports. Talking about true Japanese there is a variant of ice cream made of crushed ice and syrup, called kaki gori, that you will come across in Summer. Its a ritual to have kaki gori, as a dessert, or simply as a way to enjoy a day out in summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_516" style="width: 297px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-516" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008-287x300.jpg" alt="Birthday dessert treat" width="287" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008-287x300.jpg 287w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008-300x314.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00008.jpg 422w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Birthday dessert treat</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Children queue up outside the kaki gori stall. If you are thinking of tasting kaki gori, then try tea flavor. Green tea flavor is indeed a very popular flavor that is available in candies chocolates cakes ice creams.. Other desserts of local origin mostly trace their inheritance to either Tofu or bean paste. For more French Italian type of dessert, you may have to look for expat frequented neighborhoods such as Shibuya /Daikaniyama etc in Tokyo.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Beverages</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far we have talked only about food, not a drop to drink! Despair not. Japanese drinks are just as rich in variety as Japanese food. The most well known Japanese alcoholic drink is Sake. Distilled from rice, the colorless spirit taken warm or on ice is available in innumerable regional varieties. Good Sake is revered as it should be! It is given as offering to God; is part of all family as well as communal gettogethers.  Shochu is another variety of liquor some say distinct from sake due to the ingredients some others say due to the method of processing. Expert opinions aside, shochu is made from variety of sources such as root potato, plum, barley etc. Seasonal varieties are prized, as well advertised, such as cherry blossom liquor during spring season, plum liquor during summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_505" style="width: 286px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-505" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001-276x300.jpg" alt="Veg food served in style" width="276" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001-276x300.jpg 276w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001-300x327.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/FOOD00001.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Veg food served in style</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lately beer has become the more popular drink especially for a light-hearted meetup after office hours. Wine and whiskey are also on the upsurge. Especially champagne has touched a stature of class amongst the nouveau rich. It has forced the traditional local distillers to innovate and come up with bubbly sake. Did you know A very typical side dish to go with alcoholic drinks is green peas called Mame!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But in so far as beverages are concerned, nothing is anything like tea. Hot or cold, before during or after a meal, tea is a must. Tea is as much a Japanese tradition, as much a part of life as is sushi or Mt Fuji  The ideal lady was supposed to know the art of serving tea. Rich and famous had an outhouse dedicated for tea ceremony. While that is all tradition, and seeped in history, the common person does not go any less in devouring this beverage in every occasion. Tea is supposedly good for blood cleaning, energizing, even for reducing fat. You wanna hear more ? Aha, you must be thinking, that is all nice etc but what do You do Mr tourist when you  wake up in the morning. What about coffee? If you were thinking  it, do not worry coffee culture is spreading, with Starbucks taking the lead in the big city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But if you would like to know where to taste the dishes, indulge or experiment, drink your favorite tipple  or the cuppa, then search for the article on Japanese restaurants, eateries and food-joints. As for this article iff you would like to add more information or correct any, please drop your comment. We are listening. And yes do not hesitate to share, we appreciate ideas and social exchange. Till then, cheers</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Food for God</h2>
<p>The other day there was this article in Japan Today on environmental activism impeding traditions. The story was like this. Off in Nagano, better known for winter snow and the Onsen loving monkeys, there is a village where frogs are given as offerings to God. No neither cooked nor sashimied, simply forked and dished out. Granted this may not be to your taste of food, but then that&#8217;s not the issue. The issue is about nature. Animal lovers see it as cruel. Environmentalists are against killing frogs because frogs eat the agricultural pests thus working as a green alternative to using harmful pesticides.</p>
<p>So far so good. But have you wondered why frogs out of everything else is offered to God? Which kind of God has this particular culinary choice?</p>
<h2>Food for thought</h2>
<p>Well the answer lies also in a culture that was deeply connected to environment. Though not specifically mentioned in the Japan Today story it can safely be surmised that the God in question is the revered Inari, the fox God of Japan. One of the most popular Shinto gods, Inari temples are there on almost every street corner. Inari is the God of the masses, the people of the agrarian Japanese society. Foxes ate the rats that would have otherwise eaten away the harvests. Foxes are rats that would have otherwise lured snakes into the granaries. So it is due to  these reasons that foxes became a symbol of god&#8217;s grace, and in time a God himself. As rice farming became the main livelihood and the benefit of foxes protecting the granaries became widely known, this fox God became an important part of Japan.</p>
<div id="attachment_413" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-413" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00002-300x230.jpg" alt="Inari at shrine entrance" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00002-300x230.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00002.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inari at shrine entrance</p></div>
<p>Now you reader you may kindly note at this point that converting anything good into a tradition is a tradition in Japan. So in no time feeding the foxes became a tradition, and what better food than a freshly caught yummy frogs ?!!.</p>
<p>That could have been the end of the story here. The curious though might be interested in a bit more. So read on. The revered fox God, after his beatification, became ambitious. He was not to be left as just another God. popularity is good, but recognition is important. It soon came, in the form of a royal decree elevating His status as one of the foremost Gods. Mind it, This was not a mean feat, being recognized as one of the top few amongst the officially recognized  eight million gods! That was the beginning of a glorious journey. The rich and powerful erected grand shrines dedicated to Inari. Fushimi Inari in Kyoto became famous as a power spot of Fox God. Devotees came and erected a Torii, a simple red wooden structure representing the gate to heaven. Everyone came and erected one. The path up the mountainside  got covered in Toriis. 30,000 and counting. World took notice. Hollywood immortalized the shrine in Memoirs of a Geisha.</p>
<div id="attachment_414" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-414" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00001-300x161.jpg" alt="Hollywood at Fushimi Inari" width="300" height="161" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00001-300x161.jpg 300w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00001.jpg 619w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hollywood at Fushimi Inari</p></div>
<p>With that came tourists, business, more devotees, more fame, more tourists&#8230; well you get it don&#8217;t you.</p>
<div id="attachment_415" style="width: 198px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00003.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-415" src="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00003-188x300.jpg" alt="Kitsune" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00003-188x300.jpg 188w, https://github.com/couchflyer/cf1/wp-content/uploads/Inari00003.jpg 276w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kitsune</p></div>
<p>But then that is again not the end of the story, I am afraid. Gods have avatars, avatars have magical powers. Inari had to have as well. So came the legend of Kitsune- a magical powerful manifestation of Inari. The people&#8217;s God now transcended into the literary psyche of demons and legends of great fights. Spirits in devilish forms appeared to extract revenge on the non-believers. So whereas the original Inari was seen as benevolent God with a ball of rice in mouth, symbolizing the association with harvest, the new incarnation appeared as deviant nine tailed Devils. Soon therefore another family of rituals were born to pacify this tricky vengeful form of Inari. This one did not need any raw animal sacrifice though.</p>
<p>So, now we have two firms of the fox God, benevolent and malevolent. Two rituals to appease. And one great debate &#8211; should Inari continue to be offered frogs for lunch or not?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s think through, compare if there are other traditions that are more important to keep or stop first. and then come back another day for the specific answer to this great conundrum. Till then, um, sayonara</p>
